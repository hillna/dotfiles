(04:51:11 PM) Rachael Sullivan: So since the crohns are coming next week do you wanna go with me to target and get them a lil baby gift? I know I wouldn't be able to go to AZ for her shower. And do you want me to update shopping list?
(04:51:42 PM) Nick Hill: yeah that sounds good :)
(04:51:56 PM) Nick Hill: I think I'm going to do shopping tomorrow, since I have to go out for a few other things

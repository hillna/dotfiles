(10:42:33 AM) Whitney Gabler: Do you do any console gaming at all?
(10:43:47 AM) Nick Hill: I have my NES hooked up :D
(10:44:10 AM) Nick Hill: but barely
(10:44:32 AM) Nick Hill: no current gen systems, just an xbox 360/gamecube/PSX and classics but none hooked up
(10:44:35 AM) Whitney Gabler: haha. so you probably don't want an Xbox One then
(10:44:45 AM) Nick Hill: haha not particularly 
(10:45:05 AM) Nick Hill: the xbox one's are way too 1984 for me to be comfortable
(10:45:11 AM) Whitney Gabler: yeah. impulse buy. I used it and went .. why am I doing this I have a PC
(10:45:21 AM) Nick Hill: lol I hate when that happens
(10:45:27 AM) Whitney Gabler: shrug
(10:45:35 AM) Nick Hill: I impulse bought google glass like 
(10:45:42 AM) Nick Hill: This is the next greatest thing the future is here!
(10:45:44 AM) Nick Hill: _useless_
(10:45:51 AM) Whitney Gabler: now THAT's too 1984 for me
(10:46:10 AM) Nick Hill: haha yeah
(10:46:22 AM) Nick Hill: only until you realize how little battery it has, etc
(10:46:30 AM) Nick Hill: streaming video is not in the cards, really
(10:46:43 AM) Nick Hill: especially in any kind of surrupticious way
(10:47:17 AM) Nick Hill: if they ever do actually market it, they should not have a camera; much less creepy. But then! It's even more useless Lol
(10:47:31 AM) Nick Hill: my primary use of it was on vacation taking photos *shrugs* it belongs in theme parks and conventions, not public
(10:47:48 AM) Nick Hill: haha people in NYC would literally cross the street when I was walking around
(10:48:03 AM) Nick Hill: It was the weirdest feeling
(10:48:20 AM) Whitney Gabler: My coworker at Sbux threw a dude out because she was convinced he was recording her
(10:48:21 AM) Nick Hill: it lives on a shelf now as "tech art"
(10:48:24 AM) Nick Hill: along with my bitcoin ASIC
(10:48:31 AM) Nick Hill: Lol wow
(10:51:32 AM) Nick Hill: but creepy surveilance state aside, nothing in xbox's library has excited me. and yeah, PC. 
(10:51:40 AM) Nick Hill: linux gaming is finally viable
(10:51:53 AM) Nick Hill: still wayyy behind windows, obviously, but actually has a respectful library these days
(10:55:15 AM) Whitney Gabler: Win 10 comes out in like, a few days
(10:55:32 AM) Whitney Gabler: I don't know why they didn't just stop at 7 and iterate on that more closely.
(10:56:03 AM) Nick Hill: ms doesn't iterate
(10:56:20 AM) Nick Hill: I clicked the 'upgrade' my win8 button
(10:56:21 AM) Whitney Gabler: Well, barely ever. Windows ME and Windows Vista
(10:56:22 AM) Whitney Gabler: but yeah
(10:56:23 AM) Nick Hill: we'll see if it's any good
(10:56:42 AM) Nick Hill: looking forward to occulus integration and all that stuff
(10:57:00 AM) Whitney Gabler: Haha you remind me so much of John Carmack sometimes
(10:57:03 AM) Nick Hill: oculus* You think I would be able to spel lthat by now
(10:57:11 AM) Nick Hill: Hahahaha I don't think I've ever heard a greater compliment
(10:57:28 AM) Whitney Gabler: Haha. He is an awesome dude, true.
(10:58:05 AM) Nick Hill: I get really excited by the forefront of technology.

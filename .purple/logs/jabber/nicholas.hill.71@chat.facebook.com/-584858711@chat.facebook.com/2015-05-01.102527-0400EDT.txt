(10:30:36 AM) Dom DeStefano: That map of the US is like...holy shit.
(10:30:56 AM) Dom DeStefano: Just a testament to "I can be a LOUSY speaker but put this image up on a screen and you guys will go dead silent in awe"
(10:31:06 AM) Nick Hill: RIGHT

(10:33:47 AM) Dom DeStefano: Wtf hahaha
(10:34:13 AM) Dom DeStefano: Literally "we just don't give a shit about this keynote, we spent like 15 minutes this morning on it because more of our money goes into R&D than fucking marketing"
(10:34:15 AM) Nick Hill: I also love how they built it modularly
(10:34:22 AM) Nick Hill: have 1 kw unit, in a fancy thing
(10:34:23 AM) Nick Hill: or boom

(10:36:36 AM) Nick Hill: yeah!
(10:36:37 AM) Nick Hill: holy shit
(10:36:56 AM) Nick Hill: try build a 10kw battery bank
(10:36:59 AM) Dom DeStefano: Hahaha holy fucking hell man.
(10:37:00 AM) Nick Hill: you're in the tens of thousands at that point
(10:37:08 AM) Nick Hill: coming from data centers and all that
(10:37:10 AM) Nick Hill: they're ridiculous
(10:37:11 AM) Nick Hill: take up rooms
(10:37:16 AM) Nick Hill: rooms that need to be built specifically for battery banks
(10:37:20 AM) Nick Hill: because they will kill everyone otehrwise
(10:38:25 AM) Nick Hill: and
(10:38:26 AM) Nick Hill: made
(10:38:26 AM) Nick Hill: in

(10:40:18 AM) Nick Hill: each dedicated to a specific purpose with external support
(10:40:21 AM) Nick Hill: because _they didn't work yet_
(10:40:45 AM) Nick Hill: (granted it was done beautifully and totally unbeknownst to viewers)
(10:40:47 AM) Nick Hill: hollly shiiiit
(10:41:17 AM) Nick Hill: have giant solar farms here there elsewhere
(10:41:22 AM) Nick Hill: with regional distribution battery centers
(10:41:23 AM) Nick Hill: oh god
(10:41:37 AM) Nick Hill: HAHA
(10:41:45 AM) Nick Hill: "I'm very tempted to do the billion thing" with  his pinky in the iar

(10:44:07 AM) Nick Hill: lmao
(10:44:28 AM) Dom DeStefano: Shit's like Richard in Silicon Valley, all "I can't speak for shit but here's my Weismann Score" *everyone gasps*
(10:47:32 AM) Nick Hill: LOL
dude
(10:47:37 AM) Nick Hill: have you been keeping up on the new episodes?
(10:47:39 AM) Nick Hill: Richard is hilarious

(10:48:03 AM) Nick Hill: OH GOD
(10:48:04 AM) Nick Hill: dude
(10:48:05 AM) Nick Hill: that guy

(10:48:08 AM) Nick Hill: is so over the fucking top
(10:48:11 AM) Nick Hill: and at the same time so fucking real
(10:48:25 AM) Nick Hill: THIS GUY FUCKS
(10:52:30 AM) Nick Hill: On January 15, 2015 Elon Musk announced via Twitter that he would be building a 5 mile long Hyperloop track most likely in Texas for students and companies to work with.[ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-70) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-70)70] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-70)The company 'Hyperloop Transportation Technologies' has agreed to a deal with Quay Valley (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quay_Valley) to build a 5-mile Hyperloop track around the community. Construction is set to begin in 2016.[71] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#cite_note-71)
(10:52:33 AM) Nick Hill: I missed that somehow!
(10:52:49 AM) Nick Hill: also didn't realize the intiial hyperloop "desing" is SF to LA.
(10:52:52 AM) Nick Hill: design*
(10:55:01 AM) Dom DeStefano: Lol man.
(10:55:18 AM) Dom DeStefano: I thought Musk was all "I have this hyperloop idea but I don't have time for it, here you guys take it."
(11:00:40 AM) Nick Hill: WWOW
so
(11:00:41 AM) Nick Hill: I use
(11:00:42 AM) Nick Hill: way more
(11:00:43 AM) Nick Hill: electricity
(11:00:47 AM) Nick Hill: than I thoguht
(11:00:54 AM) Nick Hill: ~500kWh/mo
(11:01:06 AM) Nick Hill: with a US household average of ~900kWh/mo
(11:01:22 AM) Nick Hill: so 3 telsa battery banks fully charged will power a US household for a day.
(11:02:45 AM) Dom DeStefano: Each bank costing $3500?
(11:02:57 AM) Nick Hill: yep
(11:03:08 AM) Dom DeStefano: So next question is
(11:03:19 AM) Nick Hill: but it's not so much designed to be "primary power source" as suplementary
(11:03:21 AM) Dom DeStefano: How many solar panels would you need to charge a day's worth of battery banks.
(11:03:22 AM) Nick Hill: power during the no-sun hours
(11:03:23 AM) Nick Hill: tyep of things
(11:03:33 AM) Nick Hill: well you'd need ~30kWh of solar panels
(11:03:39 AM) Nick Hill: so lets see what sq ft of solar is
(11:03:42 AM) Nick Hill: no you'd need more than taht
(11:03:45 AM) Nick Hill: because you do'nt have 24 hours of sun
(11:03:54 AM) Nick Hill: but then agian you probably don't need to charge the thing from 0 in 24 hours
(11:04:16 AM) Dom DeStefano: You'd need enough solar power to run your stuff without batteries while still fully charging the batteries in daylight time.
(11:04:23 AM) Nick Hill: yep
(11:04:27 AM) File transfer cancelled
(11:04:32 AM) Nick Hill: but that can span ove ra fe days is my point
(11:04:45 AM) Nick Hill: you don't need to do that 100% charbge in an 18 hour day or wahtever
(11:04:54 AM) Nick Hill: but anyway looking up sq/ft to kwh density for solar
(11:05:26 AM) Nick Hill: "A typical installation might be about a 5 kWh array, or roughly 25 panels."
(11:05:45 AM) Nick Hill: that's 5kWh peak
(11:06:52 AM) Nick Hill: lol solar kind of sucks still
(11:07:28 AM) Nick Hill: a solar panel is like
(11:07:31 AM) Nick Hill: enough for a lightbulb
(11:07:32 AM) Nick Hill: :D
(11:07:56 AM) Nick Hill: http://www.solarcity.com/residential/how-much-do-solar-panels-cost
(11:08:00 AM) Nick Hill: one of musk's huge investments
(11:09:02 AM) Nick Hill: so for 4x 265W pannels it's $1,4298
(11:09:10 AM) Nick Hill: (from home depot with no credits blah blah blah)
(11:09:22 AM) Nick Hill: individually $400/265W
(11:09:26 AM) Nick Hill: You can power 3 lightbulbs with that!
(11:09:29 AM) Nick Hill: (incandecant)
(11:09:31 AM) Nick Hill: Fucking solar
(11:09:33 AM) Nick Hill: is garbage.
(11:09:51 AM) Nick Hill: Definitely the right direction
(11:09:52 AM) Nick Hill: we're not there yet
(11:09:54 AM) Dom DeStefano: lol well apparently *not*, if they only need that much real estate to power the entire US
(11:10:08 AM) Nick Hill: haha yeah but that's a ton of realestate
(11:10:11 AM) Nick Hill: and who knows what panels those are
(11:10:16 AM) Dom DeStefano: I mean, think of coal mines, oil derricks, nuclear reactors, refineries...
(11:10:17 AM) Nick Hill: But I'm looking at what's available to us today
(11:10:20 AM) Nick Hill: yeah totally
(11:10:25 AM) Nick Hill: I'm looking at the household picture right now
(11:10:27 AM) Nick Hill: not the national picture
(11:10:34 AM) Nick Hill: as you'er super interested in building solar "one panel at a time"
(11:10:37 AM) Nick Hill: which I'm going to say now is garbage
(11:10:39 AM) Dom DeStefano: Did you hear what France is doing?
(11:10:42 AM) Nick Hill: noep
(11:10:43 AM) Dom DeStefano: Or maybe just Paris.
(11:11:00 AM) Dom DeStefano: They're requiring that the roofs of every building either have a garden or solar panels on them.
(11:11:07 AM) Dom DeStefano: Within the next few years.
(11:11:47 AM) Dom DeStefano: One Paris worth of rooftops with solar could power all of France noooo problem.
(11:12:18 AM) Nick Hill: oh yeah I did hear about that
(11:12:23 AM) Nick Hill: one paris
(11:12:24 AM) Nick Hill: lol
(11:12:29 AM) Dom DeStefano: Unit of measurement.
(11:12:34 AM) Dom DeStefano: :D
(11:14:25 AM) Dom DeStefano: On another note, Grooveshark is dead.
(11:14:37 AM) Nick Hill: YUP
(11:14:38 AM) Nick Hill: haha
(11:14:41 AM) Nick Hill: I was talking to diana
(11:14:42 AM) Nick Hill: YESTERDAY
(11:14:44 AM) Nick Hill: about like
(11:14:46 AM) Nick Hill: music services and all
(11:14:56 AM) Nick Hill: and talking about why I stopped using grooveshark for spotify, etc
(11:21:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah man. Grooveshark was just kind of sloppy anyway. The interface was bad.
(11:21:31 AM) Nick Hill: lmao
(11:21:35 AM) Nick Hill: sloppy
(11:21:36 AM) Nick Hill: terrible
(11:21:39 AM) Nick Hill: all pirated
(11:21:41 AM) Nick Hill: mislabeled
(11:21:46 AM) Nick Hill: missing tracks off albums
(11:21:48 AM) Nick Hill: just generally horrible
(11:22:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: If they'd had a *bit* of quality assurance about it and paid some license holders, they'd still be up and running.
(11:23:39 AM) Nick Hill: hahaha yeah
(11:23:40 AM) Nick Hill: oh well
(11:25:47 AM) Dom DeStefano: So, first times yesterday... Changed my oil... And then found a tick on my skin before bed.
(11:26:05 AM) Nick Hill: first tick?
(11:26:06 AM) Nick Hill: really?
(11:26:17 AM) Nick Hill: you need to go outside more. lol
(11:26:26 AM) Dom DeStefano: I've found them on clothes before but this was the first one that was actually nomming on me.
(11:26:34 AM) Nick Hill: oh it was attached?
(11:26:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: I'm usually a lot more careful.
(11:26:51 AM) Nick Hill: yeah I've had that happen probably a dozen or so times
(11:26:53 AM) Nick Hill: once it was on my taint :(
(11:27:08 AM) Nick Hill: liek right in the taint thigh crease
(11:27:09 AM) Nick Hill: hahahaha
(11:27:11 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah. But it couldn't have been there more than a day. We were out in the woods wednesday.
(11:27:17 AM) Nick Hill: yeah
(11:27:20 AM) Nick Hill: most ticks aren't dangerous anwyay
(11:27:22 AM) Nick Hill: just annoying
(11:27:34 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah this was inner thigh right where my femoral artery is.
(11:27:38 AM) Nick Hill: https://www.facebook.com/booksofadam/videos/966857930032080/
(11:28:06 AM) Dom DeStefano: I plucked it and wrapped it in tape so it can be identified if I do get sick. Not too worried though.
(11:28:35 AM) Nick Hill: oh nice.
(11:28:41 AM) Nick Hill: yeah deer ticks are hte ones you have to worry about
(11:28:44 AM) Nick Hill: they're _super super super tiny_
(11:28:49 AM) Nick Hill: and are the common carriers of lyme 
(11:29:23 AM) Dom DeStefano: Well the woods behind my place have a lot of deer. But this guy was a little too beefy to be a deer tick. It looked like a mole at first.
(11:29:32 AM) Nick Hill: yeah
(11:29:34 AM) Nick Hill: definitely not a deer tick
(11:29:36 AM) Nick Hill: that's a dog tick
(11:29:41 AM) Dom DeStefano: Cali is full on freaked out by ticks.
(11:29:47 AM) Nick Hill: also I don't know if the name deer tick has any correlation with deer populations...
(11:29:48 AM) Nick Hill: but maybe.
(11:30:11 AM) Nick Hill: http://www.oes.org/assets/images/tiny-deer-ticks-scale-in-centimeters-4.jpg
(11:30:12 AM) Nick Hill: deer ticks
(11:30:14 AM) Nick Hill: mm scale
(11:30:15 AM) Dom DeStefano: I think it's just because deer are its common prey.
(11:30:20 AM) Nick Hill: FULLY ENGORGED on the left
(11:31:00 AM) Nick Hill: http://www.oes.org/assets/images/dog-vs-deer-ticks.jpg left are dog ticks, right are deer ticks, H is fully engorged female deer tick
(11:31:10 AM) Nick Hill: yous probably looked like B or C?
(11:31:39 AM) Nick Hill: obviously keep an eye out for symptoms yadda yadda but yeah you're probalby fine
(11:31:57 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, like B or C. Definitely.
(11:32:39 AM) Nick Hill: fucking
(11:32:39 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's hard to skeeve me out too badly.
(11:32:40 AM) Nick Hill: I HATE
(11:32:42 AM) Nick Hill: this web trend
(11:32:42 AM) Nick Hill: of
(11:32:46 AM) Nick Hill: LESS THAN 900 PIXELS WIEDTH
(11:32:50 AM) Nick Hill: YOU MUST BE ON MOBILE!
(11:32:53 AM) Nick Hill:  HERES OUR MOBILE PAGE!
(11:33:15 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yes. As do I.
(11:33:45 AM) Dom DeStefano: There is no fucking reason for mobile site forwarding anymore.
(11:33:57 AM) Dom DeStefano: Make it responsive or serve it up as is.
(11:34:44 AM) Nick Hill: OH FUCK
(11:34:51 AM) Nick Hill: I GET TO REMOVE TWO CARDS FROM MY LIST OF SHIT TO PAY
(11:34:54 AM) Nick Hill: wooooooooooOOOOOOOt
(11:37:01 AM) Nick Hill: (11:33:20 AM) Dan Lynn: I saw a talk a little while back from a guy who worked for NASA as a mission commander a few times and he's working with amateurs around the world basically building simulation space ships and mars colonies in an effort to do experiments on sustainable living in space as well as dealing with groups of people in confined spaces.
(11:33:35 AM) jedireign: ohhh gooood I lov eit
(11:35:16 AM) Dan Lynn: So I've been talking to Mel and the kids about a summer project where the kids do exactly that. There is an arts and crafts part where they come up with how they'll build their ship. They'll talk about what jobs people have to fill, figure out creative ways to use the space, effective use of limited power, etc and then do some 2-hour sessions, then 4, then maybe 8 and if some of those go well, a 24-hour mission
(11:36:55 AM) jedireign: Doing dad right, holy fuck
(11:38:17 AM) Nick Hill: LOL arrrgh
(11:38:19 AM) Nick Hill: taxxxessssss
(11:39:43 AM) Nick Hill: $1000 bonus turns into like
(11:39:47 AM) Nick Hill: $600 practical
(11:39:57 AM) Nick Hill: damn the man!
(11:51:00 AM) Dom DeStefano: Nice! Congrats!
(11:51:30 AM) Nick Hill: it was m yvacation bonus
(11:51:36 AM) Nick Hill: and I dumbly planned for $1000
(11:51:39 AM) Nick Hill: forgetting about taxes

(11:52:45 AM) Nick Hill: it's rough to sort it all out
(11:57:42 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeahhh. I hated it the worst when it was weekly. I've never gotten monthly pay day though. I think I'd dislike that more.
(11:57:50 AM) Nick Hill: I loved monthly
(11:57:53 AM) Nick Hill: budgeting was so fucking easy.
(11:58:00 AM) Nick Hill: now I have this shitty situatoin where
(11:58:05 AM) Nick Hill: I have 3000 of bills due with a 2500 paycheck
(11:58:14 AM) Nick Hill: becaus EVERYTHING COMES OUT THE FIRST WEEK
(11:58:17 AM) Nick Hill: as I've had monthly forever.
(11:58:40 AM) Nick Hill: so transitioning to this is fucking painful
(11:59:08 AM) Nick Hill: my bonus that was supposed to pay off a card so I can get plane tickets (reimbursable) is now paying m yrent :D
(11:59:10 AM) Nick Hill: essentially
(11:59:24 AM) Nick Hill: and then the next check I'll pay what was the bonus gagainst that card

(12:02:25 PM) Nick Hill: little did we expect rach to make half as much and insurance to double
(12:03:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: You should be able to call some of these places and reschedule your payments to another day of the month?
(12:03:14 PM) Nick Hill: hahahahahahahahhahahahaha
(12:03:16 PM) Nick Hill: yo'ud think that.
(12:03:40 PM) Nick Hill: trying to do so for insurance
(12:03:50 PM) Nick Hill: so
(12:03:52 PM) Nick Hill: to change my car loan
(12:03:55 PM) Nick Hill: from the 3rd to the 20th
(12:04:04 PM) Nick Hill: restructures the entire thing, adds a year to my pay off date, and costs me thousands of dollars
(12:04:07 PM) Nick Hill: I have no idea how the fuck that works
(12:04:17 PM) Nick Hill: but that's what the conversatino wti hte bank was
(12:04:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: O.o

(12:05:42 PM) Nick Hill: accusing, pescimistic, etc.
(12:05:54 PM) Nick Hill: which is why I told them to fuck themselves
(12:06:10 PM) Nick Hill: no interst ina ctually helping people, it seemed
(12:08:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Sigh...sooner or later we'll switch to a credit union.
(12:08:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's confirmed btw. I found the presidential candidate whose campaign I'm joining next year.
(12:08:29 PM) Nick Hill: oh look
(12:08:32 PM) Nick Hill: geico actually rocks
(12:08:32 PM) Nick Hill: :D

(12:08:51 PM) Nick Hill: hahahahahah
(12:08:58 PM) Nick Hill: yeah I haven't herad much from him yet other than liberatiran ticket
(12:09:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: His daddy was awesome but he's an uninformed Republican shit.
(12:09:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: His entire vote will be people who think they're on the Ron Paul bandwagon.
(12:09:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: No, Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy on the Democratic ticket.
(12:09:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: He's the guy who has been doggedly chasing the big banks for years.
(12:10:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: What would be *Really* awesome is if Elizabeth Warren shows up like a hurricane as his VP.
(12:10:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: Sanders/Warren ticket is a grand fucking slam.
(12:10:37 PM) Nick Hill: omfg Ilove gieco
(12:10:38 PM) Nick Hill: no bullshit
(12:10:39 PM) Nick Hill: no resistance
(12:10:42 PM) Nick Hill: FRIENDLY
(12:10:43 PM) Nick Hill: not
(12:10:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah I heard insurance companies were pretty chill about that shit.
(12:10:55 PM) Nick Hill: "Uuuuughhh this is cunthole from M&T Uughhh ohw can I uuhhh sighhh hhlep you"
(12:11:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: Capital One was good about my auto loan...when they first called me they were like "what day you want? That one? Okay let us know if you need to change it."
(12:11:25 PM) Nick Hill: nice
(12:11:33 PM) Nick Hill: yeah so moved $300 insurance payment
(12:11:35 PM) Nick Hill: that should help a ton
(12:11:46 PM) Nick Hill: it's a 4 pay/ 6 month policy deal
(12:11:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: Nice.
(12:12:03 PM) Nick Hill: so not due every month is nice.
(12:12:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: How are the rates out in Michigan anyway?
(12:12:10 PM) Nick Hill: so
(12:12:11 PM) Nick Hill: it's weird.
(12:12:14 PM) Nick Hill: we have no fault insurance
(12:12:18 PM) Nick Hill: which is like one of those on the fence issues
(12:12:22 PM) Nick Hill: I dont' really know whether or not it's good yhet
(12:12:26 PM) Nick Hill: but we have high rates because of it
(12:12:33 PM) Nick Hill: it's the kind of thing like
(12:12:35 PM) Nick Hill: fender bender
(12:12:36 PM) Nick Hill: is awesome.
(12:12:42 PM) Nick Hill: your insnrance deals wisth it whatever
(12:12:43 PM) Nick Hill: but if like
(12:12:51 PM) Nick Hill: some asshole tbones you and paralyzes you for the rest of your life
(12:12:53 PM) Nick Hill: yeah that's on you too.
(12:13:23 PM) Nick Hill: there is "no fault" in an auto accident
(12:13:38 PM) Nick Hill: (I think things like DWI might cvhange that though, but not positive)
(12:14:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: That's a little bit fucking dumb in any area that could possibly have bad drivers, and is entirely dependent on how stringent their licensing process is.
(12:15:06 PM) Nick Hill: yea no idea
(12:15:09 PM) Dom DeStefano: Like, if PA had insurance rules like that, I'd stay right the fuck away from northeast Philly.
(12:15:13 PM) Nick Hill: LOL
(12:15:16 PM) Nick Hill: well though
(12:15:22 PM) Nick Hill: that gets all those insurance scam assholes off the road
(12:15:24 PM) Nick Hill: that's not a thing anymore
(12:15:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: "I love you and all Cali but the fucking Boulevard."
(12:15:48 PM) Nick Hill: have you ever driven a commercial vehicle?
(12:15:57 PM) Nick Hill: people literally try and gdet you to hit them. Every. Fucking. Day.
(12:15:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: I mean...does a Uhaul count?
(12:15:59 PM) Nick Hill: no.
(12:16:16 PM) Nick Hill: they figure
(12:16:16 PM) Nick Hill: Oh
(12:16:22 PM) Nick Hill: slam on my breaks and get rear ended
(12:16:25 PM) Nick Hill: "ow my neck"
(12:16:28 PM) Nick Hill: sue them
(12:16:34 PM) Nick Hill: not hurting "anyone" because "the corporations, man"
(12:16:41 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh yeah. I've had that conversation with people.
(12:16:44 PM) Nick Hill: yep.
(12:16:45 PM) Nick Hill: every.
(12:16:46 PM) Nick Hill: single
(12:16:47 PM) Nick Hill: day
(12:16:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: That some people will look in their rear view to see if you look away.
(12:17:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: But I already drive in such a way that I have a solution to that.
(12:17:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: SAFE FOLLOWING DISTANCE.
(12:17:28 PM) Nick Hill: hahahahahahayeah
(12:17:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: It means 1 car length per 10 mph
(12:17:29 PM) Nick Hill: exactly
(12:17:31 PM) Nick Hill: fucking morons
(12:29:44 PM) Dom DeStefano: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/29/david-simon-on-baltimore-s-anguish
https://www.facebook.com/messages/584858711
(12:39:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: Man...
(12:39:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: Everything David Simon writes makes me depressed and hopeful all in one shot.
(12:52:44 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(12:56:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: That interview was fucking wow.
(12:59:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: Okay. Can I talk crazy science speculation with you?
(01:03:28 PM) Nick Hill: sure
(01:04:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: So, have you read that part of the Fermi Paradox that says that we haven't found intelligent lifeforms because there is this threshold at which intelligent lifeforms get wiped out, that is somewhere between discovering space travel and making first contact?
(01:04:59 PM) Nick Hill: Yeah
(01:05:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: So, given that speculation, this EM drive shit scares the bejeezus out of me.
(01:05:28 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(01:05:30 PM) Nick Hill: why's that?
(01:05:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: So far no one has found any way to poke holes in it, but at the same time it completely defies the laws of physics that it works.
(01:06:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: IF the Fermi Paradox is real, and I'm not saying that by any means this is scientifically true...
(01:06:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: It almost makes all this feel like there's someone pulling the strings going "haha yeah I'll make this work for you so you can fuck yourselves just a little bit faster"
(01:07:02 PM) Nick Hill: LOL wut arey ou on about
(01:07:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: Tinfoil hat theories Nick!
(01:07:17 PM) Nick Hill: hahahahaha
(01:07:18 PM) Nick Hill: dude
(01:07:21 PM) Nick Hill: that's like a tinfoil roof
(01:07:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's fun to think about, in the way that poorly written creepypasta is fun to think about.
(01:07:57 PM) Nick Hill: ahahahaha
(01:08:02 PM) Nick Hill: creepypastas are nonsense
(01:08:19 PM) Dom DeStefano: I just had this momentary thought of "this EM drive thing might maybe work but no one knows why or how, it's like something's helping us discover interstellar travel for some reason"
(01:08:47 PM) Nick Hill: nah we've discovered a thousand things before we knew why or how.
(01:08:56 PM) Nick Hill: pretty sure people had this same conversation about radio waves
(01:09:00 PM) Nick Hill: and faster than sound travel
(01:09:03 PM) Nick Hill: and air flight
(01:09:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: Like we're all in some celestial creature's snowglobe and it wants to laugh at us by showing us how to travel outside of our known domain, but when we try to do it we end up bonking against the glass and discovering that it was just an optical illusion that we ever thought it went on past any point.
(01:09:26 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(01:09:31 PM) Nick Hill: the whole petrie dish theroy
(01:09:38 PM) Nick Hill: which is the only reason I can't call myself hard athiest
(01:09:45 PM) Nick Hill: just really far leaning agnostic
(01:10:05 PM) Nick Hill: while I don't believe in any "God like being" I don't discount the possibliity of our universe being some experiment in a dish somewhere at a much larger scale
(01:10:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well, more like Deist.
(01:10:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: You have a lot of Deistic leanings. Thomas Jefferson and I thiiink Ben Franklin were Deists.
(01:10:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: But like I said, it's fun to think about, not to take seriously.
(01:10:59 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(01:11:06 PM) Nick Hill: and no I do not think I'm a diest
(01:11:08 PM) Nick Hill: deist
(01:11:37 PM) Nick Hill: but don't really discount it as a possibility
(01:11:44 PM) Nick Hill: who knows where the scale from atom to universe ends
(01:11:48 PM) Nick Hill: subatom*
(01:12:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: Anyway with that being said, I REALLY fucking hope that the EM drive gets peer-reviewed and turns out to not be a total botch-up in testing.
(01:12:26 PM) Nick Hill: But Deism reminds me of the whole "mechanical watch washes up on a beach, you've never seen a watch before, but it's far too complex to not have been created by someone. Such is the universe" that I reject wholy
(01:12:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: Because if that shit works, we will watch our entire world pivot on a hinge TWICE in our lifetimes.
(01:12:54 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(01:16:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: The Best Man

There was a time when a bride didn’t get much choice about who she married, so a groom would bring his strongest and most trusted friend in case the bride would decide to run away. He was also there for weddings where the bride’s family were against the union and might try to stop the wedding and break up the happy couple. The  word ‘Best’ refers to his skill with a sword, although we doubt many modern best men would be very useful with one. The best man stands guard next to the groom right up through the exchange of vows just in case he’s needed.
(01:17:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: Understand that you may need to brush up on your sword skills at some future date.
(01:17:54 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha that's fantastic
(01:20:22 PM) Nick Hill: That's it.
(01:20:26 PM) Nick Hill: My best man is wearing a sword.
(01:23:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: RIGHT?
(01:23:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: A functional sword.
(01:23:36 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(01:24:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Btw, in case it wasn't clear and there was some potential for awkward for you in the future, I realize I'm not your best man or probably even a groomsman.
(01:24:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: Though I think that was already clarified that your brother would be.
(01:24:35 PM) Nick Hill: I don't even think I know
(01:25:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: I *will* be flying out for that damn wedding though. Probably a little in advance so I can see what's so great about Michigan.
(01:25:33 PM) Nick Hill: haha we don't even know where we will have it
(01:25:39 PM) Nick Hill: cart and horse and all
(01:27:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: True dat.
(01:27:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: How's that coming along though?
(01:27:29 PM) Nick Hill: no change
(01:33:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Right on.
(01:33:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: Know what's really weird?
(01:33:35 PM) Dom DeStefano: Sam is *married* now.
(01:33:41 PM) Nick Hill: ha that is weird
(01:33:58 PM) Nick Hill: that whole situation totally irks me
(01:34:01 PM) Nick Hill: and I can't quite place why
(01:34:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: Not that she talks to me or anything.
(01:34:06 PM) Nick Hill: Like I guess I'm glad she's happy?
(01:34:10 PM) Nick Hill: But at the same time it feels like a sham
(01:34:10 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(01:34:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: She's not happy though.
(01:34:20 PM) Nick Hill: yeah like
(01:34:22 PM) Nick Hill: that's what I mean
(01:34:24 PM) Nick Hill: it's like
(01:34:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: She sent me this e-mail saying, literally
(01:34:30 PM) Nick Hill: uh
(01:34:35 PM) Nick Hill: "get married to "fix" a "problem" "
(01:34:36 PM) Nick Hill: or soemthing
(01:34:38 PM) Nick Hill: I dont' even know
(01:34:44 PM) Nick Hill: just not the right reasons kind of thing
(01:34:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: "I've been going to therapy but I need to stop talking to you so I can move past the life we were going to have together"
(01:34:51 PM) Nick Hill: I wonder if she's just being used for a green card or some shit.
(01:35:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: And I'm like "bitch, you are getting married in a MONTH and this is a problem for you?"
(01:35:03 PM) Nick Hill: LOL
(01:35:05 PM) Nick Hill: right?
(01:35:05 PM) Nick Hill: like
(01:35:09 PM) Nick Hill: I love how like
(01:35:11 PM) Nick Hill: she left you
(01:35:16 PM) Nick Hill: and is playing the broken up with card
(01:35:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well, we left each other, essentially. But yeah, she did also spend months after that telling me how much better Matias is for her and how awful I was.
(01:36:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: But let's be dead real with each other here. The problem isn't that she doesn't love Matias or that she misses me. That's not why she's detonating.
(01:36:54 PM) Dom DeStefano: She's detonating because her life is directionless and without meaning and she can't motivate herself to figure that shit out and thinks that her existential crisis is being caused by some external factor like a rough breakup.
(01:37:10 PM) Nick Hill: yeah that makes sense
(01:37:38 PM) Dom DeStefano: Chick is massively in debt for schooling that she's no longer motivated to use in its traditionally intended form and she doesn't have the imagination or the spine to use it in unconventional ways.
(01:37:51 PM) Dom DeStefano: She hasn't even held a steady job since we were together.
(01:38:13 PM) Nick Hill: I thought she was like mad skills chef or some shit
(01:38:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: When she was with ME I was trying to motivate her to use her cooking skills in unconventional and massively more profitable ways than working as a line cook for shit pay.
(01:38:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: Like being a personal chef for upper middle and low upper class yuppies with money and no free time.
(01:39:23 PM) Dom DeStefano: Or a food writer.
(01:39:27 PM) Nick Hill: hm I might sell a pistol at the gun show tomorrow.
(01:39:38 PM) Nick Hill: that could help immensly with this pay shit
(01:39:44 PM) Nick Hill: that would set up the buffer without touching mysavings
(01:39:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: That's kinda burning money though?
(01:40:01 PM) Nick Hill: how so?
(01:40:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Unless you think you can sell it for how much you spent on it.
(01:40:10 PM) Nick Hill: Oh yeah
(01:40:11 PM) Nick Hill: like
(01:40:14 PM) Nick Hill: pretty close
(01:40:15 PM) Nick Hill: guns hold value hard
(01:40:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well okay then.
(01:40:26 PM) Nick Hill: a police trade in beat to fuck used to shit glock generation 2
(01:40:31 PM) Nick Hill: goes for ~300?
(01:40:35 PM) Nick Hill: 350?
(01:40:40 PM) Nick Hill: brand new gen 4 never touched new in box
(01:40:42 PM) Nick Hill: $400
(01:40:43 PM) Nick Hill: 450
(01:40:58 PM) Nick Hill: thisi sa sig sauer scorpion 1911 threaded barrel
(01:41:01 PM) Nick Hill: retails for $1300
(01:41:06 PM) Nick Hill: I got it for 1100
(01:41:12 PM) Nick Hill: would sell it for 950-1050
(01:42:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: Huh okay.
(01:43:18 PM) Nick Hill: gun broker prices reflect my expectations
(01:43:40 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/1911-scorpion-tb.aspx
(01:43:49 PM) Nick Hill: and i'll even throw in an extra mag =B
(01:43:55 PM) Nick Hill: and some ammo
(01:45:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well then yeah that could be a good way of handling the financial stuff.
(01:45:48 PM) Nick Hill: yeah the problem isn't income/vs expense
(01:45:52 PM) Nick Hill: it's all jus timing.
(01:46:04 PM) Nick Hill: EVERYTHING is due first two weeks, and I don't have that buffer to cover it without using my savings
(01:46:05 PM) Nick Hill: which is like
(01:46:08 PM) Nick Hill: OFF THE FUCK LIMITS DAMN IT
(01:48:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well...honestly I'd just take a loan from savings then.
(01:49:02 PM) Nick Hill: yeah but then replenishing that puts me right back into the same place next month
(01:49:12 PM) Nick Hill: I need that in account buffer separate form my savings
(01:49:53 PM) Nick Hill: I could repurpose the savings as the buffer and then just rebuild the difference with savings contributions
(01:50:09 PM) Nick Hill: but right now for this month my bonus is myh buffer
(01:50:20 PM) Nick Hill: and I need that bonus to pay off a card so I can use that card to get reimbursed flights for summer work stuff
(01:50:21 PM) Nick Hill: :D
(01:50:22 PM) Nick Hill: it's all fun.
(01:50:25 PM) Nick Hill: this whole
(01:50:28 PM) Nick Hill: every dollar has a job game
(01:50:31 PM) Nick Hill: is fucking
(01:50:33 PM) Nick Hill: a balancing act.
(01:51:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: I don't do that as much as I could or should, but I've been doing pretty well.
(01:51:54 PM) Nick Hill: yeah Iv'e been getting more aggresive with it
(01:52:06 PM) Nick Hill: Otherwise I'm just like "Oh look at all this moneY I have left over! [toysweed]"
(02:16:29 PM) Nick Hill: woohoo selling a pistol is a lot easier in MI than PA
(02:16:39 PM) Nick Hill: PA I need an FFL to do the transaction (along with whatever their fee is)
(02:16:54 PM) Nick Hill: in MI the buyer just needs a permit to purchase from the cops (which if they're at a gun show looking to buy already have)
(02:17:05 PM) Nick Hill: $10 notary fee and background check done before hand
(02:17:11 PM) Nick Hill: so I don't need to be super diligent, either :D
(02:18:21 PM) Nick Hill: Preamble. We, the people of the State of Michigan, grateful to Almighty God for the blessings of freedom, and earnestly desiring to secure these blessings undiminished to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.
(02:18:23 PM) Nick Hill: Ohhh michigan

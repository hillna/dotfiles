(11:25:06 AM) Nick Hill: I do like the beatles e en a little bit
(11:25:09 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's really more of a 70s period story, with Beatles music as the backdrop.

(11:25:13 AM) Nick Hill: but not a whole lot of bit
(11:25:33 AM) Dom DeStefano: Think Forrest Gump but more focus on the 70s.

(11:29:42 AM) Nick Hill: then going into virtual to decide who lived
(11:29:45 AM) Nick Hill: crazy shit
(11:31:26 AM) Dom DeStefano: Haha dude, the part where Kovacs has a debate with himself to determine how to handle all that, is great.
(11:48:43 AM) Nick Hill: yeah, good book
(11:49:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Mmmhmmm, just gonna remind you though that you started a whole subreddit months in advance for Seveneves.
(11:49:49 AM) Dom DeStefano: That'd be like if I were the mod of /r/guns because I'm just pretty cool with them.
(11:49:54 AM) Dom DeStefano: :D
(11:50:18 AM) Dom DeStefano: (My Italian guilt skills are showing)
(11:57:33 AM) Nick Hill: lmfao yeah I know!
(11:57:34 AM) Nick Hill: haha
(12:49:06 PM) Nick Hill: haha our other moderator at seveneves messaged me like
(12:49:16 PM) Nick Hill: "can I be a mod I finished the book" so I was like "sure, populate our wiki"
(12:49:29 PM) Nick Hill: and he's all "Uhh I have never been a mod before I was just hoping to be recognized"
(12:49:30 PM) Nick Hill: LOL
(12:49:32 PM) Nick Hill: so we should remove him
(12:49:44 PM) Nick Hill: if he hasn't done anything to the wiki that is
(12:51:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: He's actually been very active and knowledgeable in the community.
(12:51:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: I like him.
(12:51:10 PM) Nick Hill: oh awesome!
(12:51:19 PM) Dom DeStefano: And his user name pegs him for a hardcore Stephenson fan.
(12:51:20 PM) Nick Hill: after he said that I was just like "ehhhhhhhhhhhh"
(12:51:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: Waterhouse is the surname of the main character in Cryptonomicon AND the Baroque Cycle.
(12:51:41 PM) Nick Hill: yeah I've been "avoiding" the subreddit since I haven't read anything yet lol
(12:51:54 PM) Dom DeStefano: Do! But I keep close track of the spoiler flairs.
(12:52:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: Especially since I just finished the book today.
(12:52:20 PM) Nick Hill: awesome :)
(12:52:24 PM) Nick Hill: was it everything you expected?
(12:52:31 PM) Nick Hill: the audio book was on sale for $3.50 woot woot
(12:52:46 PM) Nick Hill: I boughgt it for when we finished altered carbon, but we finished that with like ah hour to spare on our drive
(12:52:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: I hate Stephenson, a little bit.
(12:53:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: The same way I hate GRRM I guess.
(12:53:19 PM) Dom DeStefano: He ruins me for other books.
(12:53:24 PM) Nick Hill: haha
(12:53:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: I have to *force* myself to start my next book because all I want is more of this one.
(12:53:45 PM) Nick Hill: that's how I was with snow crash
(12:53:46 PM) Nick Hill: like
(12:53:46 PM) Nick Hill: bad
(12:53:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: That being said, Seveneves will leave you wanting more. I can see him turning this into a whole trilogy.
(12:54:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: The setting is *fascinating* and there is so much that can be done with it.
(12:54:12 PM) Nick Hill: especially with how suddonly it ended lol
(12:54:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: Like, on the order of Foundation.
(12:54:44 PM) Nick Hill: meeting time!
(01:07:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: Is it bad that today's XKCD made me kinda excited about The Martian?
(01:07:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: 'Cause I loved that scene in Apollo 13...
(01:09:17 PM) Nick Hill: haha that's waht I hear about the book
(01:09:27 PM) Nick Hill: it's just him problem solving the fuck out of stuff under the most pressure imaginable
(01:09:47 PM) Nick Hill: http://xkcd.com/1535/ this one is so perfect
(01:09:57 PM) Nick Hill: I call Kaylee "Buckets" half the time
(01:10:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: "Perfectly coherent words, in the pet's language"
(01:10:25 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha
(01:22:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude.
(01:22:41 PM) Dom DeStefano: How did I never know about Zach Weinersmith's Tumblr until now.
(01:22:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's like an entire other webcomic by the same guy about his personal life.
(01:22:51 PM) Nick Hill: haha oh god
(01:23:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: http://zachweinersmith.tumblr.com/image/117175469564
https://www.facebook.com/messages/584858711
(01:23:38 PM) Nick Hill: LOL
(01:36:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: Officially just ordered this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IXT30?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=od_aui_detailpages00
(01:36:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: As well as a pen that takes shapeable wires, so I can make my own custom tips.
(02:20:05 PM) Nick Hill: dude
(02:20:09 PM) Nick Hill: it's hilarious that you just linked that
(02:20:18 PM) Nick Hill: rachael just broke the tip on her cheap wood burning iron
(02:20:27 PM) Nick Hill: and I was thinking about ordering her a nice iron as a surprise
(02:20:29 PM) Nick Hill: ahaha
(02:20:35 PM) Nick Hill: this happened 15 minutes ago
(02:21:38 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude, Razertip lifetime guarantees all of their fixed tip pens.
(02:21:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: No matter what.
(02:21:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: Even against normal wear-out.
(02:21:59 PM) Nick Hill: oh yeah this is a replacable tip cheapy iron
(02:22:01 PM) Nick Hill: but that is awesome
(02:22:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Just sayin though, if you wanted to get her a nice woodburner.
(02:22:20 PM) Nick Hill: yeah I think I will go that route
(02:22:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: Also the fact that you can hold the pens so close to the wood surface as opposed to a Versa-Tool, it makes for much smoother lines.
(02:22:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's like a foam pad you put on the pen right down below the tip itself.
(02:23:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: Aaaand you can hot swap your tips.
(02:23:12 PM) Nick Hill: ohh sweet
(02:23:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: But I got the "Create a Tip" pen.
(02:23:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, it's the pen itself you swap.
(02:23:48 PM) Nick Hill: yeah I saw the combo thing on amazon
(02:23:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: The fixed tip pens are pricier than tips on a cheap pen, but since Rachael is like me and she really only uses the one kind of tip...
(02:23:52 PM) Nick Hill: the create a tip looks amazing
(02:24:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: All told, the power supply, create a tip pen, and spare wires, cost me like $210.
(02:24:25 PM) Nick Hill: think about the neat shading you could do with coils on that sucker
(02:24:26 PM) Nick Hill:  :D
(02:24:34 PM) Nick Hill: hmm yeah I might do that for rach when Iget paid
(02:24:37 PM) Nick Hill: also getting a raspi 2 for the car
(02:24:38 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yesss not to mention really really super fine lettering.
(02:24:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: I struggle with lettering.
(02:24:46 PM) Nick Hill: the B+ overclocked is still a tad under powered :(
(02:41:17 PM) Nick Hill: buttts butts butts
(02:41:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dickbutt?

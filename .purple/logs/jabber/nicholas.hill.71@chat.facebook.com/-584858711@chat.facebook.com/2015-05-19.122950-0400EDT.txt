(12:42:27 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha
(12:42:27 PM) Nick Hill: yes
(12:42:29 PM) Nick Hill: so good
(12:55:35 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(12:55:37 PM) Nick Hill: ". Yeah, I'm a big fan of being told via later story what happened behind closed doors not shown, like one character getting upset while talking about the victim to another character about what happened, thus filling in the viewer without the expense to the story or the jarring effect on the viewer."
(12:55:38 PM) Nick Hill: Yeahhh
(12:55:45 PM) Nick Hill: that guy is not ready for ASOIAF
(01:00:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: The Game of Thrones isn't really big on the flashbacks, no.
(01:01:01 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(01:01:05 PM) Nick Hill: wait did you see Sunday's?
(01:01:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: He also ought to avoid Breaking Bad, where 90% of the conflicts occur because of something that wasn't communicated between characters.
(01:02:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: There are so many situations in BrBa where you smack your forehead going "Noooo, just stop and talk about it for a sec"
(01:02:08 PM) Nick Hill: oh yeah
(01:02:12 PM) Nick Hill: not even what we're talking about.
(01:02:43 PM) Dom DeStefano: And yeah I saw this Sunday's episode. Gotta say, the show is definitely dumbing it way down.
(01:02:47 PM) Nick Hill: lmao yeah
(01:02:55 PM) Nick Hill: but I've had this on my clipboard since:
(01:02:56 PM) Nick Hill: 
"An artist has an obligation to tell the truth. My novels are epic fantasy, but they are inspired by and grounded in history. Rape and sexual violence have been a part of every war ever fought, from the ancient Sumerians to our present day. To omit them from a narrative centered on war and power would have been fundamentally false and dishonest, and would have undermined one of the themes of the books: that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves. We are the monsters. (And the heroes too). Each of us has within himself the capacity for great good, and great evil… [Westeros] is no darker nor more depraved than our own world. History is written in blood. The atrocities in A Song of Ice and Fire, sexual and otherwise, pale in comparison to what can be found in any good history book.

As for the criticism that some of the scenes of sexual violence are titillating, to me that says more about these critics than about my books. Maybe they found certain scenes titillating. Most of my readers, I suspect, read them as intended.

I will say that my philosophy as a writer, since the very start of my career, has been one of “show, don’t tell.” Whatever might be happening in my books, I try to put the reader into the middle of it, rather than summarizing the action. That requires vivid sensory detail. I don’t want distance, I want to put you there. When the scene in question is a sex scene, some readers find that intensely uncomfortable… and that’s ten times as true for scenes of sexual violence.

But that is as it should be. Certain scenes are meant to be uncomfortable, disturbing, hard to read.”
(01:03:11 PM) Nick Hill: and usually followed by this being a watered down version of the book equivilant
(01:04:00 PM) Nick Hill: I think people are somehow still expecting, "Everything to be OK!" in westeros.
(01:04:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: That's a GRRM quote?
(01:04:37 PM) Nick Hill: yup
(01:04:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: I disagree that artists have an OBLIGATION to tell the truth, but I agree with the rest.
(01:04:59 PM) Nick Hill: Yeah, pretty much
(01:05:06 PM) Nick Hill: he means honesty in that
(01:05:18 PM) Nick Hill: probably a poor choice of words because there is only hints of truth in fiction blah blah
(01:05:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: I couldn't tell you how many arguments I had a looong time before the show aired, where people called ASOIAF a pulp fiction series without substance.
(01:05:34 PM) Nick Hill: LOL wow
(01:05:39 PM) Nick Hill: READ A HSITORY BOOK
(01:05:40 PM) Nick Hill: like
(01:05:41 PM) Nick Hill: one
(01:05:41 PM) Nick Hill: ever
(01:05:55 PM) Nick Hill: seriously westeros is rainbows and candy compared.
(01:06:04 PM) Nick Hill: to CURRENT EVENTS in a large part of the world
(01:06:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: Better yet.
(01:06:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: Read Ulysses. Les Miserables. Lolita. Scarlet Letter.
(01:06:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: Red Badge of Courage
(01:06:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: All Quiet on the Western Front
(01:07:08 PM) Nick Hill: ‏‎Nick Hill ☢1:06 PMI was blown away moving out here when highways were faster than 55Ryan LaBarge1:06 PMI have been to the zoo as a kid I think@nickh some in TX go 85that is some freedom for you right there
(01:07:14 PM) Nick Hill: AHH FORMATTING
(01:09:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah man, anyone who thinks that history is gentle is an idiot. Anyone who thinks that LITERATURE is gentle hasn't read enough literature.
(01:09:56 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(01:10:00 PM) Nick Hill: I go into literature or whatever
(01:10:03 PM) Nick Hill: WANTING my mind blown
(01:10:05 PM) Nick Hill: like
(01:10:23 PM) Nick Hill: hm
(01:10:25 PM) Nick Hill: lost train of thought.
(01:10:32 PM) Nick Hill: I was going somehwere with that.
(01:10:50 PM) Nick Hill: http://cdn.meme.am/instances/400x/52006917.jpg
(01:11:54 PM) Dom DeStefano: That's the thing. Art's job is not to be honest with us. Art's job is to CHALLENGE us.
(01:12:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: To make us feel something.
(01:12:06 PM) Nick Hill: yeah exactly
(01:12:14 PM) Nick Hill: whether it's good feelings or bad feelings
(01:12:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: If art makes us feel comfortable, it's not doing it's fuckin gjob.
(01:12:18 PM) Nick Hill: if it makes you feel it did a good job.
(01:12:24 PM) Nick Hill: exactly
(01:12:36 PM) Nick Hill: I want to be torn out of my comfort zone, thrown on the ground, kicked in the gut
(01:12:38 PM) Nick Hill: and afterward
(01:12:43 PM) Nick Hill: I'll be a better person for that experience
(01:13:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: Ooh, anything by Jonathan Safran Foer.
(01:13:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: Flowers for Algernon.
(01:13:27 PM) Dom DeStefano: Man, so many works of beautiful artwork that challenge perceptions.
(01:13:29 PM) Nick Hill: reminds me of: “Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!”
(01:13:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: Heh, I like that yeah.
(01:16:12 PM) Nick Hill: argh
(01:16:19 PM) Nick Hill: I'm trying not to want to read winds of winter samples.
(01:16:20 PM) Nick Hill: Lol
(01:16:25 PM) Nick Hill: not sure how much longer I can hold out on that, though
(01:17:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: The secret is to realize that ASOIAF is nowhere NEAR the most compelling piece of literature and that there's soooo much else good you can be reading. I hardly even think about the next book.
(01:18:56 PM) Nick Hill: oh yeah - I'm just really invested in the story
(01:19:03 PM) Nick Hill: and have other books I am reading right now
(01:19:22 PM) Nick Hill: I've spent a lot of mental cycles on it lol
(01:19:32 PM) Nick Hill: but by no means do I tout it as the greatest or whatever
(01:19:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yessss we're watching A History of Violence On Demand.
(01:19:59 PM) Nick Hill: Nice!
(01:20:03 PM) Nick Hill: I need to watch that
(01:20:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yet another piece of art that is unflinching in the way that it challenges the viewer.
(01:20:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: Viggo Mortensen said it's his best work, in his opinion.
(01:21:08 PM) Nick Hill: I also read reddit today
(01:21:08 PM) Nick Hill: <3
(01:21:09 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(01:21:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: :P
(01:25:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: But yeah man, A History of Violence and American History X, classic films.
(01:38:24 PM) Nick Hill: american history X is a rough one, yeah
(01:40:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: This is up there with that.
(11:46:09 AM) Dom DeStefano: Oooh?
(11:47:34 AM) Dom DeStefano: Oooh.
(11:47:49 AM) Dom DeStefano: Man I'm kinda enjoying Seveneves so far and I'm BARELY started.
(11:48:18 AM) Dom DeStefano: Wish you were reading it right now too so we could discuss in parallel.
(11:48:33 AM) Dom DeStefano: Anathem is a thousandish.
(11:48:58 AM) Dom DeStefano: 1008
(11:49:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: Seveneves is 880
(11:49:19 AM) Dom DeStefano: lol
(11:53:30 AM) Dom DeStefano: Mm brisket.
(11:53:41 AM) Dom DeStefano: Cali made me my cookie-brownie-cake last night.
(11:53:56 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's a cake with cookie layered on top of brownie.
(11:54:39 AM) Dom DeStefano: It is sofat and so good.
(11:55:05 AM) Dom DeStefano: I wonder what Stephenson's longest book is...
(12:00:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah...I've started playing GTA V again. I just wish the PC version didn't have so much BS going on.
(12:01:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: With the PC version, and mods, and banning.
(12:01:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: And oh look, they also stopped displaying all user reviews on Steam.
(12:03:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude something fucky is up with Steam.
(12:03:49 PM) Dom DeStefano: Every single game says "no public reviews in your region"
(12:06:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: Wow.
(12:16:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: Huuuh?
(12:17:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dafuq is that.
(12:17:14 PM) Dom DeStefano: Is that just an ice strip?
(12:18:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: So wait, what the heck is this business about a stats doctor.
(12:25:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: Mmm data...
(12:25:19 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm working on Cali's inventory, putting it all digital, with backups.
(12:25:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: And she keeps going "do you reeeallly want the trouble of creating unique entries for every single unique item?"
(12:26:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: And I'm like "um dude, there could be four times as much data and I'd still be excited"
(12:26:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: Speaking of which, did I tell you about Philly Ren Faire?
(12:26:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well, one, I met Thor Bjornsson and he made me look like a widdle baby.
(12:26:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: No, Philly.
(12:27:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: This is the inaugural or "preview" year of the Philadelphia Ren Faire. It was at Fairmount Park.
(12:27:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's being run by some folks we know from the kink scene, so we got in on the ground level vending at the event.
(12:28:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: So, vending was a disorganized MESS and we ended up with our tent up by the entrance (with a separate exit), separated away from the other tents.
(12:28:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: And our 10x10 tent space cost about $150, and the tent itself (done up to look Renaissancey) cost about another $100.
(12:29:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: And even for all that, we made $900 this weekend. Which was enough to cover not only our costs for that faire, but our costs for the horror convention in July, which means the horror convention will be all profit.
(12:30:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah she does dude, she kicks my ass at it. I mean, helps that she's an artist already and I struggle to draw an outline of a dog. :D
(12:30:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: Hahaha Thor did not give a shiiit about the House Clegane coat of arms.
(12:31:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, he definitely was not there for the geeks.
(12:31:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: Although he did gleefully do a photo op where he was "crushing" a kid's head.
(12:32:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: But yeah man it was an awesome weekend.
(12:32:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: I want to do more woodburns. Maybe I'll have a few that I can sell at this horror convention.
(12:32:35 PM) Dom DeStefano: I need to start learning how to do shading more...
(12:35:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: Haha yeah man, oh god Jared makes Cali groan so much this season, I love it.
(12:35:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: Especially Jared and Carla.
(12:44:49 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh my god the stuff on that board.
(12:45:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm loving how this show is just a series of epic wins and epic fails.
(12:46:09 PM) Dom DeStefano: Apparently Mike Judge *worked* in Silicon Valley, for a graphics card company.
(12:46:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: Judge's first job was as a programmer for the F-18 fighter at Support Systems Associates, Inc. In 1987 he moved to Silicon Valley to join Parallax Graphics,[5] a startup video card company with about 40 employees based in Santa Clara. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues ("The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was"), Judge quit after less than three months and became a bass player with a touring blues band.[6]
(12:47:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: I would be willing to bet you, if there is any one character who represents Mike Judge as a character in the show, it's Erlich.
(12:47:58 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm prooobably Richard...
(12:48:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: Haha
(12:49:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: I gotta watch Blomkamp's other thing...
(12:49:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: Elysium?
(12:50:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: Sharlto Copley is a seriously underrated actor.
(12:50:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: Between District 9 and Chappie.
(12:50:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: How he just wasn't given a script for District 9.
(12:51:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: Like, that is serious levels of character acting.
(12:52:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude wat
(12:53:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: Apparently Sharlto Copley is in this series Powers that's produced by the Playstation Network
(12:54:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: "Set in a world where humans and super heroes co-exist, a former power now homicide detective, Christian Walker had his own powers taken from him. Along with his partner Deena Pilgrim they work in a special homicide division called Powers, which investigates crimes involving superhumans."
(12:54:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: Um, yes, I would give that a go.
(01:31:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: Nintendo USA just hired "Doug Bowser" as their head of sales. Bowser is now an employee of Nintendo.
(01:31:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150520005475/en/Nintendo-America-Hires-Bowser-VP-Sales#.VVzEjflVikq

(02:26:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: Uhhh no
(02:26:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: I mentioned how we worked the whole weekend, right :P
(02:27:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: We're waiting to see if our friend announces a movie night next Tuesday, and if he doesn't by Friday we're gonna go this weekend.
(02:28:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Apparently another Mad Max movie has already been announced.
(02:35:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, we'll see what happens with that. District 9 was supposed to have a sequel as well.
(04:05:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: This book is in my head. I'm going to consume it like a hungry man eating a steak.
(05:01:05 PM) Nick Hill: lol what are you talking about in your most recent fb post about vfideo  games?
(05:01:09 PM) Nick Hill: I'm sure that's targeted specifically
(05:02:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: "Life Is Strange", this new action adventure game published by Square-Enix.
(05:02:25 PM) Nick Hill: ah
(05:02:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: The story looks AWESOME, the graphics are pretty, I'm interested, BUT AFTER FIVE VIDEOS I HAVE SEEN NO GAMEPLAY
(05:02:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: I am not sitting through half an hour of video just to see how the game is played.
(05:02:52 PM) Nick Hill: jaja
(05:02:53 PM) Nick Hill: yeah

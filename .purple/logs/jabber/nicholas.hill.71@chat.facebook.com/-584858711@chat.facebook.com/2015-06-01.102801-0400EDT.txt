(10:28:01 AM) Dom DeStefano: Not yeeet
(10:30:47 AM) Nick Hill: fuuuuck-a-doodle-doo
(10:30:52 AM) Nick Hill: all the shitty sand snake fighting?
(10:30:57 AM) Nick Hill: yeah they couldn't afford a coreographer.
(10:31:02 AM) Nick Hill: and it's very apparent after last night
(10:31:03 AM) Nick Hill: :D
(10:31:23 AM) Dom DeStefano: O.o Is that a fact? About the choreographer?
(10:32:28 AM) Nick Hill: oh no
(10:32:31 AM) Nick Hill: I'm making a joke.
(10:32:35 AM) Dom DeStefano: Ahh.
(10:32:39 AM) Nick Hill: but they blew their budget load all over last night
(10:32:47 AM) Nick Hill: it was like the end of a porno
(10:32:53 AM) Nick Hill: and last night was someone's face
(10:33:13 AM) Dom DeStefano: Ooh.
(10:33:35 AM) Dom DeStefano: Well, just to chance a guess, if they were gonna do Dany's escape on dragonback, last night was a good time to do that.
(10:34:23 AM) Dom DeStefano: On another note, this morning I spent some time evaluating some stress sources, since I'm more irritable lately, and I realized one of the silliest sources of stress: Seveneves.
(10:34:32 AM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(10:34:35 AM) Nick Hill: that's hilarious
(10:34:37 AM) Nick Hill: well not hilarious
(10:34:39 AM) Nick Hill: but kind of hilarious
(10:34:41 AM) Dom DeStefano: I care about this book so much that I'm stressed out after car rides listening to it.
(10:34:46 AM) Nick Hill: Like whne I get all super stressed playing csgo
(10:38:03 AM) Nick Hill: also if we can take show canon as any indication of book canon, some of my theories have been squashed :(
(10:38:08 AM) Nick Hill: let me know when you watc hit!
(10:38:16 AM) Nick Hill: Iwant to talk about it and don't want to accidentally say the wrong thing LOL
(10:39:09 AM) Dom DeStefano: No, we can't take show canon to mean shit at this point.
(10:39:26 AM) Nick Hill: Yeah but it's like major event type of thing
(10:39:29 AM) Nick Hill: GRRM keeps saying the whole
(10:39:33 AM) Nick Hill: how many babies did what's her face have
(10:39:48 AM) Nick Hill: saying that the events will change in the show, but everything will come to the same conclusions
(10:40:26 AM) Nick Hill: this is a "it can no longer come to that conclusion" type of thing
(10:40:27 AM) Nick Hill: ... maybe.
(10:40:29 AM) Nick Hill: WHO KNOWS
(10:40:30 AM) Nick Hill: Lol
(10:40:39 AM) Nick Hill: I love the whole two tellings of the same story thing, though
(10:40:48 AM) Nick Hill: it's made me excited to watch the show and to not assume I know what's coming
(10:40:55 AM) Nick Hill: because fuck if I have any idea at this point
(10:42:06 AM) Nick Hill: https://i.imgur.com/G9bDE3G.png
(10:43:19 AM) Dom DeStefano: "The same conclusion" is the question though. What is the conclusion? Does that have anything to do with the characters? Maybe "the conclusion" is just defeating the Others, and it doesn't matter who's king or queen at the end.
(10:43:34 AM) Nick Hill: perhaps
(10:44:11 AM) Dom DeStefano: So, I'm not worried about it.
(10:44:35 AM) Nick Hill: but yeah watch that shit asap
(10:44:38 AM) Nick Hill: and then silicon valley
(10:44:54 AM) Dom DeStefano: lol
(10:44:58 AM) Dom DeStefano: Probably will tonight.
(10:44:59 AM) Nick Hill: hahahaha holy shit silicon valley, my mouth was agape for a solid 5 minutes of "OH MY FUUUCK" disbelief 
(10:45:01 AM) Nick Hill: hahahahahahahahaha
(10:45:22 AM) Nick Hill: that show man
(10:45:24 AM) Nick Hill: is fucking glorious
(10:45:49 AM) Nick Hill: did you click my imgur link?

(11:05:21 AM) Nick Hill: LOL
(11:05:22 AM) Dom DeStefano: I love Max's face in the background, expressing what we're all thinking.
(11:05:28 AM) Dom DeStefano: "What the actual fuck."
(11:05:36 AM) Nick Hill: HAHAHAHAHA
(11:05:39 AM) Nick Hill: dude so good
(11:05:44 AM) Nick Hill: I love how he dumps all the gas in there first

(11:09:41 AM) Nick Hill: after I asked our hipchat admins to add the witness me emoji.
(11:10:55 AM) Nick Hill: in other news, only a couple little tweaks left on my in car retropie emulation station
(11:11:40 AM) Nick Hill: have compltete rom lists for nes, master system, genesis, snes, gba, gb, N64, uhh some others... Doom 2, Minecraft (which runs like shit), doxbox (going to add a bunch of point and click adventure games), and I think a few other things
(11:11:41 AM) Nick Hill: FF7
(11:12:12 AM) Nick Hill: just have to get the bluetooth keyboard to reliably connect, maybe overclock it some more, and get START+SELECT to reset the emulator to exit roms
(11:12:18 AM) Nick Hill: oh and get the dpad working in snes o.O
(11:12:33 AM) Nick Hill: using wireless 360 controllers
(11:12:33 AM) Nick Hill: :D
(11:13:24 AM) Nick Hill: hooking up a little module to the cars constant and switched +12V sources, so that when the car shuts off, it keeps itself powered, signals the raspi to run a proper shutdown, then shuts the power off afer a couple of minutes
(11:16:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Oh, speaking of, we beat Minecraft on Saturday.
(11:16:45 AM) Nick Hill: ... that's a thing?
(11:16:47 AM) Nick Hill: that you can do?
(11:17:59 AM) Dom DeStefano: If you go to the End and kill the Ender Dragon, you can see the ending to the game.
(11:18:07 AM) Nick Hill: ahh neat
(11:18:17 AM) Dom DeStefano: The ending is really just scrolling text.
(11:18:23 AM) Nick Hill: I think we might have had htis ocnverstaion before, that feels familar
(11:18:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah I told you about this.
(11:18:31 AM) Nick Hill: WOW I TYPE GUD
(11:18:39 AM) Nick Hill: lol dude I have the worst memory in the world :D
(11:18:44 AM) Dom DeStefano: The last thing remaining for us to do in the "normal" game is to make, and kill, a Wither Boss.
(11:18:49 AM) Nick Hill: highly analytical, methodical, technical
(11:18:51 AM) Nick Hill: don't remember shit.
(11:18:57 AM) Nick Hill: If I don't write it down, it never happened.
(11:19:01 AM) Nick Hill: LOL You should see my bookmarks.
(11:19:06 AM) Nick Hill: slash evernote
(11:19:20 AM) Nick Hill: what's a wither boss?
(11:19:40 AM) Dom DeStefano: A fucking nightmare is what it is.
(11:19:48 AM) Dom DeStefano: You have to "build" it.
(11:19:52 AM) Dom DeStefano: Like you do with golems.
(11:20:21 AM) Dom DeStefano: You get four soul sand, and fight wither skeletons (newish monsters in the Nether, black skeletons with swords) until you get 3 of their skulls (like a 5% drop rate)
(11:20:37 AM) Dom DeStefano: The Wither Boss is a big fucker that shoots bombs that can blow up anything, even obsidian.
(11:20:46 AM) Nick Hill: oh yikes
(11:21:15 AM) Nick Hill: fuck I love gitlab
(11:21:30 AM) Nick Hill: I'm going to run a personal one instead of having my dotfiles and stuff on github
(11:21:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Did I show you this shit, btw, so, people have started doing crazy shit in Vanilla Minecraft.
(11:21:42 AM) Nick Hill: and just mirror a branch for stuff I want to share
(11:21:46 AM) Nick Hill: oh no
(11:21:49 AM) Nick Hill: I don't think so
(11:22:08 AM) Dom DeStefano: So people have started creating command blocks that can like...fundamentally change the game, in vanilla.
(11:22:12 AM) Dom DeStefano: In a single command.
(11:22:22 AM) Nick Hill: whaaaaaat
(11:22:26 AM) Nick Hill: that is so sick LOL
(11:22:30 AM) Dom DeStefano: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAvScn0zQPA Resulting in this.
https://www.facebook.com/messages/584858711
(11:23:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: Everything you see in this video is accomplished with a SINGLE COMMAND, in vanilla Minecraft.
(11:23:05 AM) Nick Hill: herobrine?
(11:23:32 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yuuup. Someone made Herobrine a boss. In vanilla. Like, I could take this command, copy and paste it in my world on PC, and fight Herobrine.
(11:23:39 AM) Nick Hill: WOOO
(11:23:41 AM) Nick Hill: "one command"
(11:23:46 AM) Nick Hill: that's one hell of a oneliner LOL
(11:23:51 AM) Dom DeStefano: Right? Hahaha
(11:24:21 AM) Nick Hill: OMFG HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
(11:24:24 AM) Nick Hill: this is insane
(11:24:46 AM) Dom DeStefano: This is the shit you can do in Minecraft now Nick. Doesn't that make you want to play?
(11:25:58 AM) Nick Hill: that summon animation was fantastic Lol
(11:26:40 AM) Dom DeStefano: Like, I can't even wrap my head around how that is accomplished.
(11:26:56 AM) Nick Hill: lol I guess the machine automates all the prereqs?
(11:27:11 AM) Nick Hill: but yeah probably one piece at a time, in a notepad, then whitespace removed
(11:27:19 AM) Nick Hill: dude haha
(11:27:22 AM) Nick Hill: this fight is incredible
(11:27:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah I mean it's unlikely to be "one line", it's more like "a whole file of commands, minimized"
(11:27:46 AM) Nick Hill: yeah totally
(11:27:49 AM) Dom DeStefano: But even so, like, all with commands in a scripting language.
(11:27:53 AM) Nick Hill: so awesome

(01:51:16 PM) Nick Hill: it's haunting to begin with
(01:51:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: Have you heard Coming Home? Or do you know about it?
(01:51:35 PM) Nick Hill: home space ball is blue
(01:51:37 PM) Nick Hill: I do not know
(01:51:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: Another musician around the time Space Oddity came out, did a response that was supposed to be from Major Tom's perspective.

(01:53:12 PM) Nick Hill: and it's fucking FEELS
(01:53:20 PM) Nick Hill: oh this is great btw haha
(01:54:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: Right? I like this just as much as Space Oddity. There are a few versions. The original has a weird tune.

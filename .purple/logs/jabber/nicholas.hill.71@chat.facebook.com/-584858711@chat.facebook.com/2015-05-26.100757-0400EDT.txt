(10:08:01 AM) Nick Hill: how was larpin NPCin?
(10:09:45 AM) Dom DeStefano: It was kinda fun actually. I did two "scenes". I was one of two prisoners being dragged along by an ogre in one, and some PCs rescued us. And then in the other, like 10 people were an orc, ogre, and goblin army that slaughtered four players.
(10:13:04 AM) Nick Hill: nice
(10:13:15 AM) Nick Hill: I'm going to a WWII reenactment in August
(10:13:23 AM) Nick Hill: along with an air show :D
(10:13:26 AM) Dom DeStefano: Only certain NPCs are given uhh, what was the term...
(10:13:31 AM) Nick Hill: dignity?
(10:13:48 AM) Dom DeStefano: GPA or something, it meant they had the authority to kill a player permanently instead of just knocking them out.
(10:14:09 AM) Nick Hill: hm interesting
(10:14:24 AM) Dom DeStefano: In this case it was the two boss monsters, I was just a lowly orc.
(10:14:38 AM) Nick Hill: so players only need to fear bosses, then
(10:14:42 AM) Nick Hill: that feels kind of nerfed
(10:14:43 AM) Dom DeStefano: But man, it was actually not that bad. The players really got into it.
(10:14:46 AM) Nick Hill: though I hae no idea what the game was like
(10:14:54 AM) Nick Hill: Yeah that's the thing that I can see redeeming larps
(10:15:00 AM) Nick Hill: is everyone staying in character and whanot
(10:15:07 AM) Dom DeStefano: Honestly if it's just a boss by themselves, they don't even need to fear the boss.
(10:15:35 AM) Dom DeStefano: In this scenario, it was four players who accidentally grabbed this lady as she teleported herself...right into the middle of an orc stronghold.
(10:15:49 AM) Dom DeStefano: They knew they were fucked before the scenario even started.
(10:16:38 AM) Nick Hill: lol
(10:17:07 AM) Dom DeStefano: But yeah, in a normal battle you'd take out the big guys first, and then clean up the little guys. So it makes sense. But aaallll of us little guys were whittling away at their HP the whole time.
(10:19:22 AM) Nick Hill: I always do normal battles the oppposite of that
(10:19:35 AM) Nick Hill: clean up the little guys to lower the total DPS and then focus on the big guy
(10:19:52 AM) Nick Hill: at least in RPGs and shit
(10:20:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: In a straight up numbers game, there's benefit to that. But in terms of more real, brain-driven combat, you want to take down the officers first. They rally the troops, give group buffs, improve morale...
(10:21:11 AM) Dom DeStefano: Think more Halo than Final Fantasy (though even in Final Fantasy, some boss fights end when you kill the boss)
(10:21:41 AM) Nick Hill: I suppose, but it's also all situational
(10:23:16 AM) Dom DeStefano: :D In this situation, they only had one way to survive the encounter anyway, and they didn't do that. Probably because LARPers are special snowflakes who aren't used to functioning as a group.
(10:24:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: The way one of the veterans put it, the only way they could survive was if the three fighters surrounded the spellcaster and defended him while he opened a portal out of the stronghold.
(10:24:08 AM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(10:24:27 AM) Dom DeStefano: But the group fragmented almost *instantly*
(10:24:35 AM) Nick Hill: yeah I think that's like the biggest
(10:24:36 AM) Nick Hill: uhh
(10:24:41 AM) Nick Hill: word I can't think of
(10:24:47 AM) Nick Hill: that kills my interst in larps
(10:24:55 AM) Nick Hill: is all the socially inepet fucktards
(10:25:02 AM) Nick Hill: like, went to comiccon
(10:25:04 AM) Nick Hill: and man
(10:25:09 AM) Nick Hill: am I embarassed to be a geek half hte time
(10:25:14 AM) Dom DeStefano: The spellcaster's very first action, at all, was to teleport away from the group. He started casting "Blink" spells and popping all over the place, just delaying the inevitable.
(10:25:50 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's not that they were socially inept. Actually the majority of the people I met there were fairly charismatic and good-looking.
(10:26:13 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's just that most of them were special snowflakes.
(10:26:20 AM) Nick Hill: lol
(10:26:34 AM) Nick Hill: LEEEROYYY
(10:26:38 AM) Nick Hill: JEEENNKIIIINNNSSSS
(10:26:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: "I'm special, I'm the most uniquest, I made a character who was cool and super and I am the hero."
(10:26:45 AM) Nick Hill: haha oh god
(10:26:46 AM) Nick Hill: yeah
(10:26:54 AM) Nick Hill: I'm the most uniqeust
(10:26:56 AM) Nick Hill: hahahahahahahahahahaha
(10:26:58 AM) Nick Hill: <3
(10:26:58 AM) Dom DeStefano: Not "I'm part of this unit. We all function. I'm not special. I'm playing my part."
(10:27:09 AM) Nick Hill: nigga you fodder
(10:27:15 AM) Nick Hill: SHINY AND CHROME
(10:27:33 AM) Dom DeStefano: But at the end of the day, all of the players had fun. When their characters died they were excited, not whiny.
(10:27:40 AM) Dom DeStefano: They all thanked us for an awesome encounter.
(10:27:46 AM) Nick Hill: nice

(10:35:56 AM) Dom DeStefano: "You have a legacy, so you'll never die"
(10:36:05 AM) Nick Hill: lol yeah
(10:36:09 AM) Dom DeStefano: But Mad Max is definitely not a movie about heavy-handed morality.
(10:36:12 AM) Nick Hill: I mean, he got his redemption, and his valhalla
(10:36:19 AM) Nick Hill: oh no not at all.
(10:36:23 AM) Dom DeStefano: Its morality is more subtle.

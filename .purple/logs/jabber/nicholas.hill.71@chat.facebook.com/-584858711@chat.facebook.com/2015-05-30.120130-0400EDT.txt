(12:01:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: That is amazing.
(05:08:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: Niiiick.
(05:08:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: I showed Cali your video.
(05:08:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: She loved it.
(05:08:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: We've been shouting War Boys lines at each other in public places all week.
(05:09:26 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(05:09:28 PM) Nick Hill: WAR BOYS
(05:12:55 PM) Nick Hill: I WILL CARRY YOU MYSELF TO THE  GATES OF VALHALLA
(05:13:01 PM) Nick Hill: WHERE YOU WIL LRIDE ETERNAL
(05:13:03 PM) Nick Hill: SHINY AND CHROME
(05:13:57 PM) Nick Hill: urgh so fucking good
(05:14:02 PM) Nick Hill: I'm going again on wednesday when Kit is in town
(05:14:05 PM) Dom DeStefano: Nick.
(05:14:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: You know more about orbital mechanics than me.
(05:14:20 PM) Nick Hill: Seveneves?
(05:14:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Explain to me why a ship that was designed to land on Earth, would not be as effective at landing on Mars.
(05:14:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: This is not a spoiler.
(05:14:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm arguing with a fan theory.
(05:14:44 PM) Nick Hill: Hmm let me think about that for a sec
(05:14:49 PM) Nick Hill: first off, not so much orbital mechanics.
(05:14:53 PM) Nick Hill: All aerodynamics.
(05:14:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: Is it air braking?
(05:15:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: It couldn't air brake in Mars atmo as well, right?
(05:15:06 PM) Nick Hill: OH yes that could very well be it.
(05:15:19 PM) Nick Hill: That and it wouldn't be able to generate as much lift (depending on propulsion methods)
(05:15:27 PM) Dom DeStefano: That's why the Curiosity and other rovers keep using "sky cranes".
(05:15:28 PM) Nick Hill: it would burn a LOT more fuel to decelerate into mars atmosphere
(05:15:37 PM) Nick Hill: only one rover so far has used a sky crane
(05:15:43 PM) Nick Hill: the rest kind of crash landed in big air bag bubbles
(05:16:26 PM) Nick Hill: for instance, the shuttle relies almost entirely on air braking after its orbital degredation burn
(05:16:34 PM) Nick Hill: it's an unpowered glider landing.
(05:17:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: Right. But Mars' atmo is thinner. I did a little reading and there some examples of Mars air braking, but they use like, sails that are unfolded.
(05:17:05 PM) Nick Hill: it's long out of fuel before it even hits the air
(05:17:22 PM) Nick Hill: Yes, thinner atmosphere means much less air braking, much less lift, etc.
(05:17:42 PM) Nick Hill: and no oxygen for turbofans, etc, so rockets are your only option.
(05:17:47 PM) Nick Hill: Meaning you have to carry all your fuel
(05:18:01 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah.
(05:18:27 PM) Nick Hill: less gravity also means orbiting at lower altitude
(05:18:31 PM) Nick Hill: and lower altitude orbits = faster
(05:18:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: Okay so I'm kinda right then, ships built to land on Earth wouldn't land on Mars. And ships built without considering landing anywhere would be no good for landing anywhere.
(05:18:41 PM) Nick Hill: In orbit you BURN FUEL to go SLOWER
(05:19:01 PM) Nick Hill: as in, push harder forward, to raise altitude, to go slower.
(05:19:01 PM) Dom DeStefano: The orbital mechanics in Seveneves makes Anathem look *mild* btw.
(05:19:05 PM) Nick Hill: lmao
(05:19:12 PM) Nick Hill: tbh, so far in anathem, orbits have been really simple
(05:19:19 PM) Nick Hill: at least where I am.
(05:19:35 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, uh, in Seveneves it's "orbital mechanics of thousands to millions of objects in concert"
(05:19:39 PM) Nick Hill: Once you're in a polar orbit, the rotation of the planet on its axis accounts for all of your "X" motion
(05:19:45 PM) Nick Hill: oh wow nice
(05:20:00 PM) Nick Hill: and your spacecraft moving accounts for all of your Y
(05:20:19 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.scientificgamer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/polar.jpg
(05:20:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: It gets into geocentric versus heliocentric
(05:20:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: And changing orbits
(05:20:34 PM) Nick Hill: right right , heliocentric is earth
(05:20:35 PM) Dom DeStefano: And L1 zones and shit
(05:20:38 PM) Nick Hill: geocentric is moon
(05:20:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: Helio is sun
(05:20:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: Geo is earth
(05:20:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: Lol they don't...
(05:20:48 PM) Nick Hill: what I mean by that is
(05:20:51 PM) Dom DeStefano: ...worry about lunar orbits in this book
(05:20:55 PM) Nick Hill: earth is in heliocentric orbit
(05:20:59 PM) Nick Hill: moon is in geocentric orbit
(05:21:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh, yeah.
(05:21:47 PM) Nick Hill: L points are _fucking nuts_ btw
(05:21:48 PM) Nick Hill: just like
(05:21:51 PM) Nick Hill: understanding them
(05:21:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah dude, it gets into this.
(05:22:00 PM) Nick Hill: it's a "stationary position" by balancing helio/geo orbits
(05:22:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: The book's version of Elon Musk deals with it a lot.
(05:22:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: Lol this book has Elon Musk and Neil Degrasse Tyson in it.
(05:22:25 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(05:22:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's incredible.
(05:22:26 PM) Nick Hill: man.
(05:22:34 PM) Nick Hill: I need to finish anathem so I can get on that shit
(05:22:37 PM) Nick Hill:  I should read today.
(05:22:45 PM) Nick Hill: I have an awful headache though :( so I think it's a netflix kinda day.
(05:22:49 PM) Dom DeStefano: Seveneves is already my favorite Stephenson book.
(05:22:56 PM) Nick Hill: fantastic :D
(05:22:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm abooout at the halfway point.
(05:23:08 PM) Nick Hill: you read fast.
(05:23:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: Audiobook.
(05:23:23 PM) Nick Hill: ah
(05:23:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: I listen every time I get in the car to go somewhere.
(05:23:40 PM) Nick Hill: awesome
(05:23:43 PM) Nick Hill: yeah commutes help with that :D
(05:23:50 PM) Nick Hill: I burned through so many dunes that way.
(05:24:01 PM) Nick Hill: but Ihave a hard time focusing on audiobooks, I miss a lot
(05:24:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: I can't listen to audiobooks when I'm working or even sitting on the computer.
(05:24:56 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(05:24:59 PM) Nick Hill: driving isn't so bad
(05:25:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: I do miss a bit sometimes in the car, but Seveneves is okay for that.
(05:25:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's not one of those "shit changes massively in a single unassuming sentence".
(05:25:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's "Stephenson spends 5 minutes explaining the shit that just happened"
(05:25:38 PM) Nick Hill: lol nice
(05:25:41 PM) Nick Hill:  :D
(05:30:10 PM) Nick Hill: thttp://phys.org/news/2015-05-self-folding-robot-climbs-dissolves.html
(05:30:12 PM) Nick Hill: this is fucking
(05:30:13 PM) Nick Hill: what the fuck
(05:31:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: They're like the little bots from Big Hero 6...
(05:31:51 PM) Nick Hill: I still havbe not watched that.
(05:32:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's really good. I dunno if it was Oscar material. But it was a well made film.
(05:33:00 PM) Nick Hill: Eh I'm totally jaded about the oscars - it is of no measure to me.
(05:33:42 PM) Nick Hill: it's like the AAA game industry
(05:34:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah.
(05:34:28 PM) Nick Hill: So much better shit out there that should be recognized that isn't even noticed
(05:34:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Fantastic flick though. So is Song of the Sea.
(05:34:37 PM) Nick Hill: Sweet :) Yeah haven't seen either
(05:34:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: Song of the Sea is so quintessentially Irish.
(05:34:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: Like on a par with Secret of Kells (made by the same studio)
(05:35:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: The folklore in Song of the Sea is only true in the names and some of the explanations, the stories and characterization are not quite right. But still.
(05:46:26 PM) Nick Hill: Have you watched Hannibal at all?
(05:46:39 PM) Nick Hill: the series? We just finished the second season, awaiting the third to air this week.
(05:46:42 PM) Nick Hill: It's fucking fantastic
(05:48:18 PM) Nick Hill: https://i.imgur.com/ap8bqYf.jpg LOL god damn it
(05:48:28 PM) Nick Hill: that shit is hilarious
(05:50:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: I want to, I haven't yet.
(05:50:21 PM) Nick Hill: definitely recommend it
(05:50:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: I do love me some Silence of the Lambs.
(05:50:45 PM) Nick Hill: I might even go as far as saying I prefer this "iteration" of hannibal lector to Anthony Hopkins
(05:51:05 PM) Nick Hill: 1) Austrian accent.
(05:51:15 PM) Nick Hill: 2) Seems much more collected.
(05:52:02 PM) Nick Hill: and stays _very_ true to canon, so far.
(05:52:12 PM) Nick Hill: Other than Will Grahm's "sudden realization" from Red Dragon, that is.
(05:53:30 PM) Nick Hill: Have you seen all of the films?
(05:53:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: Wait, what do you mean about Will Graham's sudden realization?
(05:53:48 PM) Nick Hill: (I haven't seen Manhunter, the first film adaptation of hannibal lector, way before Hopkins)
(05:53:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: Do they get it right in the show?
(05:54:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: Or is it like, Graham is slowly coming to suspect over the course of the show.
(05:54:13 PM) Nick Hill: We're not at that part in the show, but Will pretty much KNOWS who hannibal is, through a LOT of events
(05:54:22 PM) Nick Hill: but not how to catch him, or prove it, or even get the FBI on his side.
(05:54:43 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh, okay. So it's not like, he's been working with Hannibal for ages, and realized while looking at a book of Hannibal's in his study.
(05:54:48 PM) Nick Hill: whereas the brief bit of that process we saw in red dragon was Will consulting with hannibal, and a light bulb going off in his head
(05:54:52 PM) Nick Hill: Right.
(05:55:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah dude, I read Red Dragon...at least ten years ago and I still remember that lol.
(05:55:09 PM) Nick Hill: Though I haven't read the books, personally, I dont' know how that plays out there
(05:55:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm a bit of a Hannibal fan.
(05:56:46 PM) Nick Hill: but yeah I'm hoping season 3 is final
(05:56:54 PM) Nick Hill: otherwise I worry they will drag it on too long
(05:57:21 PM) Nick Hill: and I really hope buffalo bill makes an appearance as a patient :D
(05:57:36 PM) Nick Hill: which I pretty much expect they _have_ to do as a lot of hannibals other ... interactions ... are presenst.
(05:57:38 PM) Nick Hill: present. 
(05:58:10 PM) Nick Hill: and oh god
(05:58:11 PM) Nick Hill: his kitchen
(05:58:16 PM) Nick Hill: FUCK I WANT THAT KITCHEN
(05:58:24 PM) Nick Hill: this show makes me so hungry.
(05:58:50 PM) Nick Hill: you get so much of a better feel of Hannibals arrogance over those he sees as lesser than 
(06:00:09 PM) Dom DeStefano: In fairness, they can continue the story past Hannibal's capture.
(06:00:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: Will Graham working with Hannibal in captivity, Clarice Starling coming onto the scene, Hannibal's escape...
(06:00:44 PM) Dom DeStefano: They can just retell all of that shit in a more expanded canon.
(06:01:19 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'd love to see the story of the Hannibal movie told properly. The part they *didn't* show in the movie, at the end. How Clarice got free without Hannibal or Clarice losing a hand.
(06:01:55 PM) Nick Hill: oh this is _all_ prior to the events of red dragon
(06:02:10 PM) Nick Hill: and didn't they show 100% that hannibal cuts off his own hand?
(06:02:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: No. He doesn't.
(06:02:26 PM) Nick Hill: Oh man it's been a while.
(06:02:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: When he's feeding the little girl human meat on the plane he has both of his hands.
(06:02:41 PM) Nick Hill: Ah yeah good point
(06:02:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: They don't say in the movie what they say in the book. It's the reason Jodie Foster wouldn't play Clarice in Hannibal.
(06:02:55 PM) Nick Hill: but yeah Hopkins was terrifying in his contempt and brutality
(06:02:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: Wanna know what happens?
(06:02:59 PM) Nick Hill: this telling is terrifying in his control.
(06:03:00 PM) Nick Hill: yes :D
(06:03:23 PM) Dom DeStefano: Clarice kisses him again, unlocks the handcuffs, helps him kill the FBI agent and escape, and claims Hannibal got the drop on her.
(06:03:38 PM) Nick Hill: which is totally the type of character ths hannibal is
(06:03:54 PM) Dom DeStefano: Her lifetime of strangeness as an FBI profiler percolates into Hannibal fostering her to become another serial killer and his lover.
(06:04:04 PM) Nick Hill: They describe him really well in one scene, where they say how he will _convince you_ to do things, but not in a coersive way, but in a way that it feels like it's the only choice you have.
(06:04:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: Jodie Foster refused to play the role because she didn't want Clarice to become "a bad guy" at the end.
(06:04:27 PM) Dom DeStefano: But Julianne Moore had no such qualms. :D
(06:04:30 PM) Nick Hill: lol jodie foster can suck it
(06:04:46 PM) Nick Hill: also julianne moore did a fucking great job not only becoming clarice starling, but becoming jodie foster's clarise.
(06:05:01 PM) Nick Hill: the actor change felt seemless
(06:05:18 PM) Nick Hill: imo at least
(06:05:48 PM) Nick Hill: lmao that makes me mad, though
(06:06:00 PM) Nick Hill: jodie foster's reaction
(06:06:05 PM) Nick Hill: lol what a puss.
(06:06:12 PM) Nick Hill: THIS IS ART, not good guy bad guy good guys win fantasy
(06:06:14 PM) Dom DeStefano: So yeah dude I wanna see Hannibal the show do that.
(06:06:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: That would be a freaking incredible series finale.
(06:06:36 PM) Nick Hill: lol yeah, I don't know how far into the story they plan to follow it
(06:06:44 PM) Nick Hill: I'm expecting it will end with his capture
(06:06:59 PM) Nick Hill: but now that you mention this, I really hope not ;)
(06:07:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, they probably don't want to interfere with the movies, even if they don't share a common canon.
(06:07:44 PM) Nick Hill: I think the idea is that they do share common canon
(06:08:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: So, you don't know anything about the story of season 3 yet?
(06:08:38 PM) Nick Hill: nope it airs this week
(06:08:51 PM) Nick Hill: S2 ended with a very familiar film character.
(06:09:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm cheating a little right now and reading into it so I don't wanna spoil for you.
(06:09:02 PM) Nick Hill: Argh I wish I could just talk about this without stepping around spoilers LOL
(06:09:09 PM) Nick Hill: OH WELL THEN.
(06:09:15 PM) Nick Hill: Mr spoilers
(06:09:16 PM) Nick Hill: haha
(06:09:16 PM) Nick Hill: <3
(06:09:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: But I'll say that the way they're doing it, they could very well go into a 4th season.
(06:09:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: And beyond.
(06:09:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: Movies be damned.
(06:09:30 PM) Nick Hill: sweeeeet
(06:09:42 PM) Nick Hill: yeah I feel like the show runners could do a _better job_
(06:09:47 PM) Nick Hill: of the stories in the moies
(06:09:51 PM) Nick Hill: horror has evolved a LOT since what?
(06:09:52 PM) Nick Hill: 1992?
(06:09:53 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(06:09:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: I saw Red Dragon the movie and I read the book, the movie is kinda weak.
(06:10:16 PM) Nick Hill: yeah? nice
(06:10:22 PM) Nick Hill: I think red dragon is my least favorite of the movies
(06:10:31 PM) Nick Hill: Verger is the most interesting character.
(06:11:32 PM) Nick Hill: HAHA wtf http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xZ-WissIWm0/hqdefault.jpg
(06:11:38 PM) Dom DeStefano: Have you read the book for Red Dragon?
(06:11:47 PM) Nick Hill: none of them
(06:11:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: There are some fundamentally fucked up scenes about Dolarhyde that are left out of the movie.
(06:11:51 PM) Nick Hill: sadly :(
(06:12:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: His harelip isn't even that pronounced in the movie. It's freaking mild.
(06:12:33 PM) Nick Hill: I'm ok with book spoilers, though
(06:12:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: So, in the book.
(06:12:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dolarhyde is obsessed with that dragon painting.
(06:13:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: He breaks into the Met, murders a curator, and *eats* the painting.
(06:13:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: This is a major scene in the book and is toootally left out of the movie.
(06:13:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: As is a lot of the flashbacks about his upbringing as I recall. His serious harelip, the bullying, the grandmother kicking him and screaming at him all the time.
(06:14:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dolarhyde is supposed to be a tragic villain but the movie makes him out to be sorta...cookie cutter.
(06:14:40 PM) Nick Hill: Yeah you get very little glimpse into his past
(06:14:46 PM) Nick Hill: And yet it's what Will uses to take him down
(06:14:47 PM) Nick Hill: go fig.
(06:15:02 PM) Nick Hill: you'd think they'd build on that important of a plot point lol
(06:15:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: The movie also doesn't get into the fact that Hannibal almost *murders* Will.
(06:15:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: In the book, Hannibal teases Will regularly about his colostomy bag. The one he has to wear because Hannibal perforated his colon in his attack.
(06:17:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: It really serves to demonstrate Will and Hannibal's relationship, that Will was smart enough to catch him and he did possibly the most humiliating kind of harm you can do to a person. Living with a colostomy bag seems hellish to me.
(06:18:06 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao wow I completely forgot about Will being a double asshole
(06:18:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: Haha yeah...man those books are fucked up.
(06:18:23 PM) Nick Hill: BOOM END OF SEASON 2
(06:18:25 PM) Nick Hill: btw.
(06:18:27 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(06:18:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: You ought to watch Luther as well.
(06:18:58 PM) Dom DeStefano: Luther is what would happen if Idris Elba played a British Will Graham, and Hannibal Lecter was a woman.
(06:19:02 PM) Nick Hill: yeah so far the first two seasons have been like
(06:19:16 PM) Nick Hill: a multi year long extrapolation of the "realization" in hannibal
(06:19:19 PM) Nick Hill: err red dragon
(06:19:21 PM) Nick Hill: in the best way possible
(06:19:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Idris Elba as Luther is just...emotionally damaged and it's amazing.
(06:19:58 PM) Dom DeStefano: Gets into that dichotomy of "the criminal profiler is only a step away from the criminals he hunts"
(06:21:05 PM) Nick Hill: Yeah that's basically Hannibal (TV)
(06:21:29 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.popculturemaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hannibal-season-2-blu-ray-cover.jpg
(06:21:33 PM) Nick Hill: ^ Will
(06:22:23 PM) Nick Hill: also Jack Crawford, behavioral sciences lead at FBI, is Lawrence Fishbourne
(06:22:32 PM) Nick Hill: he's such a good actor who does not get enough work, I think.
(06:22:50 PM) Nick Hill: AND HIS WIFE IS ZOE
(06:22:53 PM) Nick Hill: uhhh
(06:22:54 PM) Nick Hill: fuck waht's her name
(06:23:09 PM) Nick Hill: Gina Torres
(06:23:31 PM) Nick Hill: yeah dude it's on my Plex if you want to watch it :)
(06:23:53 PM) Nick Hill: first few episodes, I was expecting totally episoding plots
(06:23:54 PM) Nick Hill: NOPE
(06:23:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh man...
(06:23:58 PM) Nick Hill: episodic*
(06:24:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: An actor cast for season 3...
(06:24:04 PM) Dom DeStefano: I really wanna watch this show now.
(06:24:09 PM) Nick Hill: dude it's good.
(06:24:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: Don't look at any casting news or IMDB pages.
(06:26:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: ...
(06:26:40 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(06:26:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: My five year old just used the word "lagging" to describe controller lag in Minecraft.
(06:26:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: Without any input for me.
(06:26:55 PM) Nick Hill: dude I didn't even realize S3 was coming until like 3 episodes before the end of 2
(06:26:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: from*
(06:26:56 PM) Nick Hill: then
(06:27:00 PM) Nick Hill: OH IT"S COMING OUT IN A WEEK!?
(06:27:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: "I think it's not lagging anymore"
(06:27:05 PM) Nick Hill: it was a glorious moment for rachael and me.
(06:27:06 PM) Nick Hill: hahahahahaha
(06:27:19 PM) Dom DeStefano: A five year old knows what lag is.
(06:27:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: MY five year old.
(06:27:27 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(06:27:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Moments like these...
(06:27:39 PM) Nick Hill: wait until you feel like a dumbass when he's coding apps at like 13
(06:27:50 PM) Nick Hill: like "what do you mean you've worked your whole life to getg here dad this shit's easy"
(06:28:51 PM) Dom DeStefano: She*
(06:28:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's Eva.
(06:28:58 PM) Dom DeStefano: She has a serious Minecraft addiction.
(06:29:03 PM) Nick Hill: oh shit sorry lol
(06:29:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: And she's starting to get into shooters now to.
(06:29:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: too*
(06:29:10 PM) Nick Hill: I keep forgetting your kids ages :D
(06:29:14 PM) Nick Hill: and think they're younger than they are
(06:29:21 PM) Nick Hill: like Eva's 5 already!?
(06:29:22 PM) Nick Hill: holy shit
(06:29:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: Cale is 9, Eva's 5.
(06:29:30 PM) Nick Hill: YIKES yeah that's ridiculous 
(06:29:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: He's gonna be TEN this year dude.
(06:29:33 PM) Nick Hill: haha TIM FLIES MOTHERFUCKER
(06:29:40 PM) Nick Hill: TIM THE ENCHANTER
(06:29:43 PM) Nick Hill: but time is what I meant.
(06:30:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: I googled "tim flies" and the top result was Carlton from Fresh Prince...
(06:30:38 PM) Dom DeStefano: I am not entirely sure why.
(06:31:55 PM) Nick Hill: o.O
(06:31:56 PM) Nick Hill: ...
(06:31:57 PM) Nick Hill: why not.

(12:04:47 AM) Dom DeStefano: Which implies heavily that they're just going to disregard the movies.
(12:04:53 AM) Nick Hill: yup
(12:04:56 AM) Nick Hill: well
(12:04:57 AM) Nick Hill: perhaps.

(12:14:26 AM) Dom DeStefano: I've actually been tempted to write a little fanfic for Seveneves.
(12:14:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: This story is one of those that makes me think about the shit happening on the periphery of the story.
(12:15:00 AM) Dom DeStefano: You don't even know how hard it is not to talk to you about this shit!
(12:17:00 AM) Nick Hill: lmao I knowww I'm sorry
(12:17:11 AM) Nick Hill: I'm debating putting anathem on hold to read this
(12:17:19 AM) Dom DeStefano: I feel like this will engage you more.
(12:17:25 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's got better pacing.
(12:17:25 AM) Nick Hill: I am really diggin anathem, but that being said, I have not had the motivation to pick it up lately
(12:17:29 AM) Nick Hill: It's so good but so laborious
(12:17:43 AM) Dom DeStefano: I definitely would not fault you for picking this up and taking a break. I've done it.
(12:18:09 AM) Nick Hill: hm I have nothing to do tomorrow but aquire greenery
(12:18:12 AM) Nick Hill: I will pick it up then.
(12:18:21 AM) Dom DeStefano: YEY
(12:18:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Even if you read the first page we can at least TALK ABOUT IT.
(12:18:40 AM) Dom DeStefano: There's really no hesitation in kickstarting the story.
(12:21:17 AM) Nick Hill: lol
(12:21:42 AM) Dom DeStefano: I've managed to get a good lock down on the spoiler tags for the sub, too.
(12:21:59 AM) Nick Hill: I saw, good shit
(12:22:03 AM) Dom DeStefano: The book seems to be divided into three distinct parts, so you can say you finished part 1 and talk about anything from there.
(12:27:58 AM) Nick Hill: https://imgur.com/a/ODOi0#0
(12:28:52 AM) Dom DeStefano: Maaan...I wanna write.

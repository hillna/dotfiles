(07:35:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: Changing your oil is EASY!
(07:35:43 PM) Dom DeStefano: ...but messy.
(07:35:55 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao yup
(07:35:57 PM) Nick Hill: stupid easy
(07:36:09 PM) Dom DeStefano: I couldn't change my filter because it was machine tightened but we decided I don't need to for another 10,000 miles anyway.
(07:36:18 PM) Nick Hill: wut
(07:36:23 PM) Dom DeStefano: I got it changed 5K ago.
(07:36:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: And it says every 15K.
(07:36:32 PM) Nick Hill: what kind of oil filter do you have?
(07:36:34 PM) Nick Hill: ah interesting
(07:36:39 PM) Nick Hill: sure that wasn't air filter?
(07:36:42 PM) Nick Hill: that would make more sense...
(07:36:44 PM) Dom DeStefano: Apparently it's like a...synthetic optimized oil filter.
(07:36:50 PM) Nick Hill: ah neat
(07:36:54 PM) Dom DeStefano: It says 15K right on there.
(07:37:00 PM) Nick Hill: oh on the filter, ok
(07:37:05 PM) Nick Hill: wasn't surif you got that  from manual or nto
(07:37:06 PM) Nick Hill: nice!
(07:37:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah man.
(07:37:18 PM) Nick Hill: and yeah mother fuckers tighten those things
(07:37:18 PM) Nick Hill: way
(07:37:19 PM) Nick Hill: too
(07:37:19 PM) Nick Hill: much
(07:37:21 PM) Nick Hill: for no reason
(07:37:22 PM) Nick Hill: HAND TIGHT
(07:37:31 PM) Nick Hill: not HAND PLUS ALL YOUR BODY LEVERAGE TIGHT
(07:37:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: Cali was mad, yeah, she said it's supposed to be hand tight.
(07:37:49 PM) Dom DeStefano: This had to be more than just body leverage. This was machined.
(07:37:53 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(07:37:56 PM) Nick Hill: not necessaryil
(07:38:02 PM) Nick Hill: they expand and get _fucking tight_
(07:38:07 PM) Nick Hill: but not unlikely either
(07:38:23 PM) Nick Hill: but there's literally no reason to own the specialized tool to do so
(07:38:24 PM) Nick Hill: haha
(07:38:34 PM) Nick Hill: and if they have it, and use it, etc, don't ever take your car to there again
(07:38:45 PM) Nick Hill: well ok I guess it's usefull for removing stuck oil filters...
(07:38:49 PM) Nick Hill: but god damn it fucking oil filters.
(07:38:58 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha why is this something that is done so consistently wrong?
(07:39:04 PM) Nick Hill: by"professionals"
(07:39:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well, when it comes time to change the filter I'm gonna use a tool to loosen it and then I'll never have to worry about it again because it'll be hand-tightened.
(07:40:00 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(07:40:06 PM) Nick Hill: get a set of strap wrenches
(07:40:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: They also put a little blue latex like...seal...on the bolt.
(07:40:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: That made it a bitch to remove.
(07:40:15 PM) Nick Hill: Multipurpose, unlike an oil filter wrench
(07:40:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: Good Year did this.
(07:40:20 PM) Nick Hill: wait
(07:40:22 PM) Nick Hill: wait wait wait
(07:40:25 PM) Nick Hill: on the DRAIN PLUG?
(07:40:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah man.
(07:40:29 PM) Nick Hill: THEY USED LOCTITE ON YOUR DRAIN PLUG!?
(07:40:30 PM) Nick Hill: WHAT
(07:40:32 PM) Nick Hill: THE FUCKING FUCK
(07:40:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: Wait. Is that gonna get in there and fuck it up?
(07:40:51 PM) Nick Hill: no
(07:40:53 PM) Nick Hill: it's just ABSURD
(07:41:00 PM) Nick Hill: that's like a 10 ftlbs bolt
(07:41:03 PM) Nick Hill: like
(07:41:08 PM) Nick Hill: barely anything tight.
(07:41:20 PM) Nick Hill: loctite is meant to keep bolts from walking out
(07:41:23 PM) Nick Hill: it's basically bolt glue.
(07:41:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh. Well we're talking about Goodyear here, I'm not surprised they deliberately went out of their way to make it a pain in the dick for me to change my oil myself.
(07:41:34 PM) Nick Hill: you use that on shit like your suspension.
(07:41:36 PM) Nick Hill: sounds the fuck like it
(07:41:38 PM) Nick Hill: jesus christ
(07:41:48 PM) Nick Hill: next thing you know they'll be selling you muffler bearings
(07:42:15 PM) Nick Hill: yeah my rule is "get you filthy hands off my car"
(07:42:25 PM) Nick Hill: unless it's something warranty.
(07:42:29 PM) Nick Hill: it's hard to argue with free & guaranteed.
(07:42:46 PM) Nick Hill: but I still don't fucking trust them
(07:42:47 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha
(07:42:48 PM) Nick Hill: adude
(07:42:50 PM) Nick Hill: I brought my car in
(07:42:51 PM) Nick Hill: like
(07:42:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: Man I cannot fucking wait to get a Tesla.
(07:42:54 PM) Nick Hill: "This is what's wrong with it"
(07:42:58 PM) Nick Hill: "Fix it under warranty"
(07:42:59 PM) Nick Hill: blah blah bla
(07:43:01 PM) Nick Hill: dude's like
(07:43:03 PM) Nick Hill: Welllllllll
(07:43:05 PM) Nick Hill: Ohhhkayyyyy
(07:43:10 PM) Dom DeStefano: I keep randomly going...
(07:43:14 PM) Nick Hill: then calls me up a few hours later like "OMFG YOU WERE RIGHT!!!"
(07:43:15 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(07:43:18 PM) Nick Hill: no fucking shit I was wright.
(07:43:22 PM) Nick Hill: I can look up a diagnostic code, too.
(07:43:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: "I wonder how much this will cost to fix in a Tesla. Oh wait...this won't even BE in a Tesla."
(07:43:32 PM) Nick Hill: ahahahahahaha
(07:43:33 PM) Nick Hill: though
(07:43:43 PM) Nick Hill: you now have barely vetted new tech to dea lwith with tesla
(07:43:49 PM) Nick Hill: though I'll put my eggs in that basket.
(07:43:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah I think it's doable.
(07:44:04 PM) Nick Hill: doing amazing shit already
(07:44:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: Speaking of which today was the big day.
(07:44:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: Elon Musk announcing in-home batteries made by Tesla Motors.
(07:44:32 PM) Nick Hill: oh nice
(07:44:44 PM) Nick Hill: get that solar flowin!
(07:45:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: Haha I was quizzing Cali about solar shit since her mom's boyfriend installs solar panels.
(07:45:07 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(07:45:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'm like "could we set it up so we have an array but we can start with one panel and add one at a time over time."
(07:45:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: She's like "Installation would be expensive but we have Tim so fuck yeah"
(07:45:33 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(07:45:37 PM) Nick Hill: DIY installation
(07:45:37 PM) Nick Hill: boom
(07:45:44 PM) Nick Hill: how hard is it to wire a few wires and climb on a roof?
(07:45:50 PM) Nick Hill: especially when the base system is already there :D
(07:45:53 PM) Nick Hill: have the inspector come
(07:45:55 PM) Nick Hill: switch it on
(07:45:55 PM) Nick Hill: boom
(07:45:56 PM) Nick Hill: done
(07:46:17 PM) Nick Hill: I bet a solar panel is like 1/10th the difficulty of hanging a door.
(07:46:19 PM) Nick Hill: Fucking DOORS
(07:46:22 PM) Nick Hill: are the worst part about houses.
(07:46:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: Lol I'll bet.
(07:47:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: Man...
(07:47:03 PM) Nick Hill: ahahaha I always appreciate a well hung door
(07:47:05 PM) Nick Hill: (giggity)
(07:47:08 PM) Nick Hill: they're so few and far between
(07:47:14 PM) Nick Hill: especially with the like mcmansions popped upe everywhere
(07:47:17 PM) Nick Hill: built l.ike garbage.
(07:47:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Cali and I have been pointing out every large but run down and decrepit house we drive past.
(07:47:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: "I wonder how cheap that would be to buy and fix up."
(07:47:40 PM) Nick Hill: haha
(07:47:44 PM) Nick Hill: not very
(07:47:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well, we intend to explore the option next year.
(07:47:57 PM) Nick Hill: my brother's about to buy my grandmom's house
(07:47:59 PM) Nick Hill: and it need slike 
(07:48:01 PM) Nick Hill: a TON OF WORK
(07:48:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: Cheap shit house with a good frame.
(07:48:07 PM) Nick Hill: and it's nowhre near "decrepit"
(07:48:11 PM) Nick Hill: but it's to the point that it's like
(07:48:12 PM) Nick Hill: Boom
(07:48:16 PM) Nick Hill: smash it
(07:48:17 PM) Nick Hill: rebuild
(07:48:23 PM) Dom DeStefano: Drop like $30-50K on it, spend $100K fixing it up...
(07:48:48 PM) Nick Hill: Land is the expensive part, most of the time
(07:48:51 PM) Nick Hill: 100k is a LOT of house.
(07:48:56 PM) Nick Hill: like if you bought land
(07:49:00 PM) Nick Hill: then spent 100k building a house
(07:49:03 PM) Nick Hill: that would be a LOT OF HOUSE
(07:49:31 PM) Nick Hill: like swap those numbers is more realistic
(07:50:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: :D Well, some of these houses we've pointed out, we could easily haggle down one of them to $50K.
(07:50:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: Alternately we're also picking neighborhoods we like where the houses are in good shape but STILL cheapo.
(07:51:00 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao you sure you want to live where there's property being sold that low? Yikes
(07:51:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: And in gorgeous neighborhoods.
(07:51:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh I'm doing fuuullll research. One of the neighborhoods, the houses are a bit run down but the crime rate is nil, it's like a backwoods right behind my apartment complex.
(07:51:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: I live right on the edge of "ghetto in the woods" New Jersey AKA Atco.
(07:51:52 PM) Nick Hill: hahahaha
(07:52:14 PM) Nick Hill: fucking atco
(07:52:27 PM) Dom DeStefano: I mean, we have a year and a half now. We decided to put off this plan for a year.
(07:52:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: So I'm gonna renew my lease in July and she's gonna work on her credit for the next year, sort out her student loan shit into a manageable form.
(07:53:23 PM) Nick Hill: worrd
(07:53:30 PM) Nick Hill: yeah I'm doing the whole credit kickass thing right now
(07:53:31 PM) Nick Hill: fucking
(07:53:37 PM) Nick Hill: work chagned from monthly to biweekly pay
(07:53:39 PM) Nick Hill: and it is fucking me so hard
(07:53:44 PM) Nick Hill: EVERYTHING is due the first week of the month.
(07:54:08 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao luckily I made extra post-due-date payments last month which is hte only reason I'll be able to pay rent this month without dipping into savings
(07:54:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Lol gotta learn how not to spend all your money now huh?
(07:54:16 PM) Nick Hill: Because the accounts  due have zero due balanace
(07:54:26 PM) Nick Hill: haha no I've always saved and all that
(07:54:30 PM) Nick Hill: and had good balance
(07:54:40 PM) Nick Hill: but now I have 3500 woth of shit due with 2800 in pya
(07:55:17 PM) Nick Hill: transitioning is the rough part - few months should get a good buffer going
(07:55:26 PM) Nick Hill: but right now it's just fucked me all up lol
(07:56:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh so you mean it's *just* for this pay period.
(07:56:13 PM) Nick Hill: oh yeah
(07:56:13 PM) Nick Hill: like
(07:56:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: That is a bit of fuckery, yeah...
(07:56:19 PM) Nick Hill: not "oh no my bills are more than I make"
(07:56:25 PM) Nick Hill: it's oh no they're due before I get my money
(07:56:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh hey man did you ever hear anything further back from Google?
(07:56:32 PM) Nick Hill: hahahahahaha
(07:56:33 PM) Nick Hill: nope
(07:56:39 PM) Nick Hill: bommmmmbed that one
(07:56:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: The second one?
(07:56:51 PM) Nick Hill: never had a second one
(07:57:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: Ahh. Well dude. You got approached by them. No shame in that.
(07:57:14 PM) Nick Hill: haha yeah
(07:57:20 PM) Nick Hill: nor do I have any real interest in moving to mountain view
(07:57:23 PM) Nick Hill: I have interest in big paychecks
(07:57:27 PM) Nick Hill: and perks
(07:57:32 PM) Nick Hill: really the only reason I'd want to work for google
(07:57:45 PM) Nick Hill: I'm not at all upset about not being a faceless nameless recognitionless cog in a GIGANTIC machine
(07:58:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: Hmm. Yeah, I guess even Google is kinda gonna be cog-like.
(07:58:33 PM) Nick Hill: especially since I'm trying to move myself away frmo them in personal life because, frankly, I don't trust them anymore
(07:58:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: I...kinda like being a little fish in a big pond. Is that sad? I just wanna do the job and get paid. DNAinfo burned my ambition away.
(07:58:50 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha oh yeah I totally get that
(07:58:53 PM) Nick Hill: I still have that ambition I guess.
(07:58:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: I do have this ambition to do my own shit though. Writing and a couple of app projects.
(07:59:07 PM) Nick Hill: I'm highly ambitious and lowly motivated.
(08:00:13 PM) Nick Hill: oh did I tell you I got my NFA trust all sorted out?
(08:02:23 PM) Nick Hill: With such hilarious notraized bureacracy as:
(08:02:59 PM) Nick Hill: Assignment of Property
I, NICHOLAS ARTHUR HILL as Settlor of HILL NFA TRUST, dated APRIL 27, 2015, hereby assign and transfer all of my rights, title and interest in the following property:
One Dollar, United States Federal Reserve Note.
(08:03:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: NFA trust?
(08:03:18 PM) Nick Hill: made a revokable living trust to own firearms under
(08:03:29 PM) Nick Hill: for silencers and short barreled and shit
(08:03:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: So is that a liability thing?
(08:03:45 PM) Nick Hill: more of an estate thing
(08:04:01 PM) Nick Hill: and makes the process of obtaining much simpler
(08:04:17 PM) Nick Hill: I won't need local LEO approval, finger prints, or any of that stuff.
(08:04:26 PM) Nick Hill: Still have to go through the whole background check process, though, on the ATF's side
(08:04:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: Huh.
(08:04:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: OH GUESS WHAT
(08:04:40 PM) Nick Hill: and approval takes like 5 months from application for tax stamp and approval and delivery
(08:04:46 PM) Dom DeStefano: Someone gave me a fucking Bitcoin tip on Reddit the other day.
(08:04:53 PM) Nick Hill: haha sweet
(08:05:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: I had to set up a changetip account and so I said fuck it and set it to route all tips to charity.
(08:05:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: Anyway.
(08:05:04 PM) Nick Hill: that's another thing I lost when I killed jedireign
(08:05:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Gunnnns.
(08:05:10 PM) Nick Hill: my bitcointip account with like $10 in it.
(08:05:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: My co-worker told me the next hunting season he's gonna give me his deer hides.
(08:05:25 PM) Nick Hill: whooops
(08:05:43 PM) Nick Hill: nice
(08:09:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: Anyways I'm gonna pop off and do some reading. I finished writing up all kinds of shit about this stalker bitches and I have been burnt out so I'm taking it easy for a few days.
(08:49:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: Weeeelll traipsing out in the woods yesterday had a fun reminder to go along with it.

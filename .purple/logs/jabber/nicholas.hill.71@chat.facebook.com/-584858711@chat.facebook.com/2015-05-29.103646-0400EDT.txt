(10:37:05 AM) Dom DeStefano: Had to go put in my contacts.

(10:37:35 AM) Dom DeStefano: lol
(10:57:37 AM) Dom DeStefano: So remind me, you're familiar with the animation of Don Hertzfeldt, right? The stick figure cartoons of the early 2000s? Rejected, "my spoon is too big" and all that?
(11:00:49 AM) Dom DeStefano: So, he made a full length feature film for Sundance and it's on Netflix, called "It's Such a Beautiful Day"
(11:01:04 AM) Dom DeStefano: And we watched it, thinking "oh, it'll be funny and irreverent and mock a subculture".
(11:01:29 AM) Dom DeStefano: And at first we're like "oh, it's funny and irreverent, makes us vaguely uncomfortable, and mocks the weird abstraction of Sundance film culture"
(11:01:35 AM) Dom DeStefano: Until it ruined our lives.
(11:04:11 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's heavy for a cartoon dude. Way heavy.
(11:11:25 AM) Dom DeStefano: You should, but you've been warned.
(11:30:32 AM) Dom DeStefano: That is bizarre.
(11:30:41 AM) Dom DeStefano: But then Naughty Dog's offices let people bring their dogs to work.

(10:46:45 AM) Nick Hill: resort

(10:47:13 AM) Nick Hill: "Olark&rsquo;s stance - We do require Olarkers to be sober during work hours. During recreational time we ask that you respect the rules of the YMCA, as we are their guests. We encourage you to use your best judgement to ensure your fellow Olarkers feel welcomed and included."

(12:44:53 PM) Dom DeStefano: Mad Max was one of the games previewed at an E3 like two years ago, it looked pretty but it's been taking awhile.

(01:14:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: I guess I need to read "The Martian" by Andy Weird.
(01:15:01 PM) Dom DeStefano: Weir*
(01:15:58 PM) Dom DeStefano: You see the Reddit post on the front page right now? Apparently he posted about it on his Facebook and Buzz Aldrin liked it and commented that his Mission Director recommended it to him.
(02:32:06 PM) Nick Hill: ahhh 3D ultrasounds are fucking amazing
(02:42:05 PM) Nick Hill: "Every supercharger shown in the film was real and functioning—for at least one take. "We did lose some cars to the desert," says designer Gibson."
(02:42:08 PM) Nick Hill: Stop, I can only get so erect.
(02:42:13 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-12/every-killer-car-in-mad-max-fury-road-explained
(02:47:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: Ugh such a good fucking movie.

(02:47:57 PM) Nick Hill: omfg.

(02:48:05 PM) Nick Hill: the complete
(02:48:06 PM) Nick Hill: LACK
(02:48:07 PM) Nick Hill: of CGI
(02:48:08 PM) Nick Hill: holy shit.
(02:48:30 PM) Nick Hill: something like 90% practical effects
(02:54:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: We figure mooost of the CG that was done was just on that big storm scene at the beginning.
(02:54:24 PM) Nick Hill: that and probably parts of the citadel
(02:54:35 PM) Nick Hill: and some flame effects, according to that article
(02:54:39 PM) Nick Hill: but those were "enhancements"
(02:54:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah probably.
(03:12:35 PM) Nick Hill: http://imgur.com/gallery/8KTujEH
(03:13:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: "I read that most of the CGI was used to enhance the landscape or Charlize Theron's arm. The rest was practical effects." From the comments.
(03:14:23 PM) Nick Hill: haha yeah her arm! derp
(03:14:46 PM) Nick Hill: "So, Charlize, we're going to ask yo uto make a major sacrifice, for the sake of the film.."
(04:22:02 PM) Nick Hill: https://i.imgur.com/KqBVqpw.jpg
(04:41:28 PM) Nick Hill: AHAHAHAH YOOO
(04:41:29 PM) Nick Hill: So
(04:41:37 PM) Nick Hill: I just got a lockpick kit, from massdrop.com
(04:41:37 PM) Nick Hill: right
(04:41:55 PM) Nick Hill: picked my first master padlock in literally 15 seconds
(04:41:56 PM) Nick Hill: LOL
(04:41:59 PM) Nick Hill: first picked lock, ever.
(04:45:20 PM) Nick Hill: HAHA
(04:45:32 PM) Nick Hill: and 20 seconds on their "high end" padlock
(04:45:43 PM) Nick Hill: holy shit what an easy thing to do.
(04:45:44 PM) Nick Hill: Wow.
(04:49:09 PM) Nick Hill: hahahaha
(04:49:29 PM) Dom DeStefano: Hahaha that's neat. Man, stephenson has a joke in reamde about hackers and lockpicking hobbies.
(04:49:35 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(04:50:05 PM) Dom DeStefano: You and stephenson would either be best friends or fight to the death.
(04:50:13 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(04:50:17 PM) Nick Hill: I imagine he's incredibly arrogant
(04:50:19 PM) Nick Hill: but who knows!
(04:50:23 PM) Nick Hill: I may have that opportunity
(04:50:26 PM) Nick Hill: also he's on a level way above me.
(04:50:32 PM) Nick Hill: it would be a mentor relationship
(04:56:27 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.nealstephenson.com/social-media.html granted, this is just relating to social media
(05:08:29 PM) Nick Hill: Yesss
(05:08:38 PM) Nick Hill: rachael's doing me a wood burn of the citadel skull
(05:12:23 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.filedropper.com/vectorwheel if you want a high quality vector of it for your own purposes :)
(05:52:56 PM) Nick Hill: :D rach just started that
(06:06:06 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oooooh.
(06:15:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: The way that last message was structured was...odd.
(06:15:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah..
(10:01:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: Nommuch. Wearing my contacts for the first full day.
(10:02:28 AM) Dom DeStefano: Little blurry but the doc got a better read on what scrip I'd need so when I order my main ones they should be clearer.
(10:02:58 AM) Dom DeStefano: Right? Oh man, also my glasses always had this weird way of being a tiny bit blurry close up, so I'd look over the rim...
(10:03:16 AM) Dom DeStefano: I had my contacts in last night and tried to look at something close up, and bent my head to look over the rims of my glasses...
(10:03:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, I'm really noticing a lot of the subconscious mannerisms that went with a lifetime of wearing glasses.
(10:05:08 AM) Dom DeStefano: My vision is baaad. And I have astigmatism in both eyes.
(10:06:45 AM) Dom DeStefano: Could be.
(10:07:06 AM) Dom DeStefano: Astigmatism is a problem with the eye attempting to focus on specific objects.
(10:07:30 AM) Dom DeStefano: Lenses that correct for that ought to work with holo sights and anything else.
(10:08:45 AM) Dom DeStefano: :D I doubt if I'll ever use a holographic sight for anything, so.
(10:09:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: So in other news, I want you to be reading Seveneves SO BAD.
(10:09:14 AM) Dom DeStefano: Stephenson's new geekdom as of this book is HAM Radio and Morse Code. He adds more geekdoms every book he writes.
(10:10:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: Listen to the audiobook dude. Having a voice to talk out the technical Stephensonian details helps.
(10:10:48 AM) Dom DeStefano: Seveneves goes into a lot of detail about the...well I can't say. A major piece of technology that drives the central story. I forget, how much do you know about the premise of this book?
(10:11:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: Okay. Yeah, I was gonna say, the synopsis is kinda shitty.
(10:12:00 AM) Dom DeStefano: I'm about 10 hours into the 31 hour audiobook.
(10:12:48 AM) Dom DeStefano: It's funny because the synopsis avoids a major early book spoiler, while giving major late book spoilers.
(10:53:29 AM) Dom DeStefano: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eqCaiwmr_M
(11:53:30 AM) Dom DeStefano: Lol Bill Nye is great.
(11:58:54 AM) Dom DeStefano: We did too! This weekend! It was awesome.
(11:59:38 AM) Dom DeStefano: Brb, making a run to Acme for contact solution stuff, and then we need to talk about AGOT and Silicon Valley.
(11:59:41 AM) Dom DeStefano: Niiice.
(12:31:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: They are fucking destroying the Sand Snakes and it pisses me off.
(12:38:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: Which is sad, considering it's the first season that we can reliably say is completely separate from the books.
(12:39:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Eww, fuck you no, kill no one.
(12:39:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: I didn't want Grey Worm to die either.
(12:39:48 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude, fuckin', the guy who plays Selmy was RAW about it on Twitter.
(12:42:09 PM) Dom DeStefano: And Russ.
(12:42:14 PM) Dom DeStefano: This episode is CLASSIC Russ.
(12:43:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Also, this episode has a line in it, an ah ha moment, that will make you scream and point at the television.
(12:43:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: I pointed and went "HOLY FUCKING SHIT NICK WILL LOVE THAT"
(12:43:26 PM) Dom DeStefano: Russ Hanneman.
(12:43:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: The crazy rich dude.
(12:46:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeahh...
(12:46:57 PM) Dom DeStefano: This show reinforces my desire to get out of CompSci.
(12:49:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: Engineering sales?
(12:49:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: I forget, do you consider yourself an extravert?
(12:51:31 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh, so not the person actually doing the selling, more like the guy in between engineering and sales who helps sales understand how to do the selling?
(01:12:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: I WAS GONNA SAY THAT
(01:12:24 PM) Dom DeStefano: I was literally getting to the "I'M A PEOPLE PERSON" line
(07:22:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-710-5521-Silver-Color-Mist/dp/B005KTVG86/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1432768924&sr=8-1&keywords=wilton+silver+color+mist

(09:25:31 AM) Dom DeStefano: Man. Now I wanna do a Mad Max woodburn. I wonder what I could do...
(09:25:32 AM) Nick Hill: Will this stain my mouth and teeth? (http://www.amazon.com/forum/-/Tx3O1FLV4QMB87J/ref=ask_dp_dpmw_al_hza?asin=B005KTVG86)A: IT WILL STAIN THEM WITH GLORY, SHINY AND CHROME.
(09:25:33 AM) Nick Hill: LOL
(09:25:41 AM) Dom DeStefano: :D
(09:26:10 AM) Nick Hill: My Warboys use this all the time, a real step up from using toxic chrome spraypaint which was causing odd tumors.

(10:13:24 AM) Dom DeStefano: So, let's talk for a second about how no one will ever have a job as cool as being the herald of Immortan Joe's war party.
(10:13:44 AM) Nick Hill: Ahahaha the Doof Warrior?
(10:13:50 AM) Nick Hill: his back story is fucking _SICK_
(10:14:14 AM) Dom DeStefano: You can be cool, but you can't be playing a flaming electric guitar on the front of a huge sound system vehicle with drums cool.

(10:15:20 AM) Nick Hill: So what does he do?
(10:15:32 AM) Nick Hill: MAKES HIM A MASK OUT OF HER SKIN (he's blind, btw)
(10:15:51 AM) Nick Hill: To Honor her as he signals the warboys
(10:16:46 AM) Nick Hill: Best scene of his is when h'es getting the shit beat ouf of him

(10:18:49 AM) Nick Hill: alright, office time, back on in a bit
(10:19:11 AM) Dom DeStefano: THAT IS EPIC FUCKED UP
(10:19:17 AM) Nick Hill: RIGHT
(10:19:18 AM) Nick Hill: hahahahahaha
(10:19:24 AM) Dom DeStefano: lol
(12:21:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: Cali got a new phone last night, the Galaxy S6. You know they took out the Micro SD slot, right?
(12:55:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's really dumb. But her camera is disgusting. It's like DSLR quality, just without the ability to add specialized lenses.
(02:00:14 PM) Dom DeStefano: Wait, have you not seen this whole thing? I thought I sent it to you.
(02:00:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: It's amazing.

(02:00:52 PM) Dom DeStefano: This entire thing is comedy gold.
(02:04:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: Omg he's great.
(02:04:56 PM) Dom DeStefano: He reminds me of Josh, if Josh's gleeful excitement about everything constantly teetered on the edge of violence.
(02:10:09 PM) Dom DeStefano: Man, everything about that video...
(02:11:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, and then it's Coldplay participating in a joke at their own expense.
(02:16:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: Ahh Liam Neeson.
(02:16:25 PM) Dom DeStefano: I think that's all part of this comedy charity thing NBC is doing.
(02:20:23 PM) Dom DeStefano: SPEAKING OF GAMES
(02:20:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: Did you try Outlast yet?
(02:24:11 PM) Dom DeStefano: I'onno, I don't play FPS type games with controllers.
(02:24:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: Well, truth be told, I haven't gotten a controller working with ANY Steam game yet...
(02:25:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: I dunno what I need to do to get a wireless controller working with Steam.
(02:26:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yes, but wireless controllers.
(02:26:38 PM) Dom DeStefano: PS3, XBox 360, XBOne, don't care. I have no idea what makes the controller talk to the system. It's a hardware problem.
(02:28:01 PM) Dom DeStefano: ...it seems like the XBox One controller works best out of all of them actually.
(02:28:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: XBox official site says I can hook it up straight via the micro USB.
(02:28:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controller-pc-compatibility
https://www.facebook.com/messages/584858711
(02:28:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh, I don't care about wireless, I just meant it's a wireless *controller*
(02:31:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah I know, that's what I was worried about here.
(02:31:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: Now that I know that works fine, I'm golden.
(02:39:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah, the One controller is as vast an improvement over the 360 controller as the PS3 controller is over the PS2.
(02:39:55 PM) Dom DeStefano: PS3's controller is pretty awesome. Built-in rechargeable battery, mini-USB...
(02:40:35 PM) Dom DeStefano: This is true, but mine has lasted like 4 years.
(02:40:51 PM) Dom DeStefano: Probably longer, I forget when I got PS3...maybe 6 years ago.
(02:41:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude, the 360's rechargeable batteries are poop.
(02:44:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: Neat!
(03:19:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: Just hanging out, while Cali plays Bioshock Infinite.
(03:19:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: Work was slow today. I'm between projects.
(03:23:30 PM) Dom DeStefano: Lol she just fought her first Handyman.

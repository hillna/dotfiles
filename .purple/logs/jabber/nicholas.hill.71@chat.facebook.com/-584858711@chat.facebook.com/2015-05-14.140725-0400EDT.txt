(02:19:01 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(02:36:16 PM) Nick Hill: http://www.reddit.com/r/seveneves/

(02:36:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: A bunch of like, little doodles of robots and spaceships.
(02:36:49 PM) Nick Hill: wtf
(02:36:50 PM) Nick Hill: ok
(02:36:58 PM) Nick Hill: I made a new img (you can see in the sytlesheet)
(02:37:01 PM) Nick Hill: maybe it's cached in CDN or some shit
(02:37:11 PM) Nick Hill: especially since the image name never changed :D
(02:37:23 PM) Nick Hill: I will fix in stylesheet
(02:38:21 PM) Dom DeStefano: Hmmm yeah I see the updated image attached, and it's referenced in the stylesheet...
(02:38:33 PM) Nick Hill: yeah
(02:38:37 PM) Nick Hill: but that old image was there w/ same name
(02:38:45 PM) Nick Hill: so I'm going to update CSS with new updloaded called seveneves
(02:39:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Sit tight a sec
(02:40:00 PM) Nick Hill: YEP
(02:40:02 PM) Nick Hill: it was CDN
(02:40:04 PM) Nick Hill: new image is there
(02:40:15 PM) Nick Hill: aha looks like garbage
(02:40:25 PM) Nick Hill: gotta tweak it a bit more
(02:40:34 PM) Nick Hill: lower the image a bit and we'll be good :D rockon
(02:41:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah...it must cache the image in the CDN. That's stupid. You can't bust the cache at all. Any time you change your header image you have to name it something new and change all the variable references to it in the stylesheet.
(02:41:49 PM) Nick Hill: lol or just wait
(02:41:58 PM) Nick Hill: cdn has to refresh at some ponit
(02:42:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Uff, who the fuck knows when that cron job runs though, I'm impatient, I want my shit *now*.

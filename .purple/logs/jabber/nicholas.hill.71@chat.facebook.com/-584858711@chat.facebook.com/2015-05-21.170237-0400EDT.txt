(05:02:37 PM) Dom DeStefano: Neal Stephenson is you as a science fiction author, I swear. Funniest line I've ever heard in a Stephenson novel (no spoilers): "The qualifications of being a scout seemed to be a shocking level of physical endurance, a complete disregard for mortal danger, and some knowledge of how to exist in a spacesuit. All of them were Russian."
(05:03:07 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(05:04:44 PM) Dom DeStefano: This is quickly gearing up to supplant Anathem as my favorite Stephenson novel.
(05:06:24 PM) Nick Hill: nice
(05:12:22 PM) Dom DeStefano: ...Apparently the set for Metropolis was 60,000 square feet, in miniature. Did you see this Reddit thing about the biggest sets in cinema?
(05:13:05 PM) Nick Hill: Yeah man ridiculous
(05:13:15 PM) Nick Hill: fucking didn't expect war games to be on that list.
(05:13:23 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude what EVEN, Batman used 4.1m square feet?
(05:14:15 PM) Dom DeStefano: Ahahahaha the film set version of NORAD was so good that it forced the real NORAD to make it prettier.
(05:15:01 PM) Dom DeStefano: I also like how the director of The Goonies intended to capture the children's genuine reaction to the ship, and the kids fucked up the take by swearing excessively.
(05:20:37 PM) Nick Hill: LOL I didn't read that part
(05:20:38 PM) Nick Hill: amazing
(05:40:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh guess what, you know The Button? The Reddit April Fools thing?
(05:40:52 PM) Nick Hill: yeah?
(05:41:02 PM) Dom DeStefano: I got red flair today. 7 seconds.
(05:41:06 PM) Nick Hill: wut?
(05:41:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: You get different colored dots as a flair on the Button's subreddit, depending on where the timer is when you press.
(05:41:40 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(05:41:42 PM) Dom DeStefano: I pressed the button when the timer was at 7 seconds and I got a red flair, the lowest possible.
(05:42:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: The whole button is a social experiment in class division dude, it's hilarious when it's not circle jerky.
(06:57:01 PM) Nick Hill: :D
(06:57:05 PM) Nick Hill: spun up gitlab today
(06:57:08 PM) Nick Hill: it's so nice.

(01:02:10 PM) Nick Hill: lol nice
(01:03:18 PM) Dom DeStefano: Hey you've seen Mad Max, can you answer a few simple yes/no questions real quick?
(01:03:40 PM) Nick Hill: yep
(01:04:39 PM) Dom DeStefano: 1. Do any of the female characters resolve their own or someone else's conflict without needing to be saved or rescued?
2. Do any of the female characters make any statements of self-analysis or introspection?
(01:05:08 PM) Nick Hill: 1. ish? yes?
(01:05:28 PM) Dom DeStefano: 1 can be something simple, like "lady character shoots one of the bad guys"
(01:05:32 PM) Nick Hill: lmfao
(01:05:35 PM) Nick Hill: oh then one thousand times yes
(01:05:49 PM) Nick Hill: the ish is mad max is around to help, in the macro sense
(01:05:55 PM) Nick Hill: but not even at first
(01:06:08 PM) Nick Hill: and yes, to 2w
(01:06:09 PM) Nick Hill: 2*
(01:06:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: 2 can be more abstract though, like...she looks at herself in a mirror? She talks about a goal or a dream she has?
(01:06:33 PM) Nick Hill: yeah basically
(01:06:39 PM) Nick Hill: ignore all the MRA drivel about htis movie
(01:06:45 PM) Dom DeStefano: Okay, so then women are well-represented in Mad Max.
(01:06:48 PM) Nick Hill: yes.
(01:07:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: That's the Dom Test, my version of the Bechdel Test.
(01:07:11 PM) Nick Hill: lol
(01:07:20 PM) Dom DeStefano: You know Bechdel, maybe?
(01:07:22 PM) Nick Hill: yep
(01:07:27 PM) Dom DeStefano: My test is:
(01:07:36 PM) Dom DeStefano: 1. Has a character of the gender in question
(01:07:47 PM) Dom DeStefano: 2. Who solves at least one problem for themselves
(01:08:01 PM) Dom DeStefano: 3. And shows some moment of self-awareness or introspection.
(01:08:38 PM) Nick Hill: yeah the _ENTIRE PLOT_ is women solving their own shit
(01:08:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: Presence, empowerment, agency
(01:08:40 PM) Nick Hill: that max gets caught up in
(01:08:49 PM) Nick Hill: if anything max is a secondary character
(01:09:13 PM) Dom DeStefano: If THEY save HIM at any point, that's even more points in their favor.
(01:09:26 PM) Nick Hill: hahahaha yep
(01:09:39 PM) Nick Hill: this is why all the MRA nonsnese
(01:09:39 PM) Nick Hill: haha
(01:09:48 PM) Nick Hill: WTF STRONG WOMEN I WANT A HAREM FUCK MAD MAX PRPAGANDA
(01:11:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Oh, I haven't seen any of the MRA nonsense, there's just an argument on /r/sciencefiction about whether it's feminist or not.
(01:12:23 PM) Nick Hill: oh I gotcha
(01:12:30 PM) Nick Hill: not sure how you'vbe avbodied it
(01:12:31 PM) Nick Hill: it's like
(01:12:42 PM) Nick Hill: to the point where I suspect it was publicity stunt LOL
(01:12:51 PM) Nick Hill: But yeah
(01:12:56 PM) Nick Hill: there are strong AND weak femal characters in it
(01:13:03 PM) Nick Hill: and the same with men
(01:16:49 PM) Dom DeStefano: Because I avoid most fora where gender issues are discussed except for a very few.

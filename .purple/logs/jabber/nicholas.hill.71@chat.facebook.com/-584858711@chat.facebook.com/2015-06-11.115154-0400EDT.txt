(11:54:07 AM) Dom DeStefano: Once we get past this convention in July we'll see how things look about a road trip.
(11:54:24 AM) Nick Hill: awesome :)

(11:58:41 AM) Nick Hill: I have minecraft on that bitch!
(11:58:49 AM) Dom DeStefano: Oooooh
(11:58:51 AM) Nick Hill: (runs like shit though, hence upgrading to 2)
(11:59:02 AM) Dom DeStefano: Dude the command block shit in that game.
(11:59:04 AM) Dom DeStefano: Is amazing.
(11:59:07 AM) Nick Hill: putting heatsinks on the chips, putting it in a case with a fan, overclocking it, and mounting it behind the glove box
(11:59:40 AM) Nick Hill: xbox controller in the glove box to control the whole shebang :D
(12:03:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: Niiice

(12:03:45 PM) Nick Hill: I'm sure I'm forgetting some consoles in there
(12:04:37 PM) Nick Hill: I have to redo the OS portion for the raspi 2, but that shouldn't be a huge undertaking
(12:05:12 PM) Nick Hill: hardest part is probably getting the bluetooth keyboard working lmao
(12:35:37 PM) Nick Hill: 24 minutes for oculus announcement :o
(12:44:45 PM) Nick Hill: 15 minutes!
(12:45:00 PM) Dom DeStefano: Woooo
(01:00:55 PM) Nick Hill: HAHA OH GOD
(01:00:58 PM) Nick Hill: tghey're doing it on twitch
(01:01:00 PM) Nick Hill: and the chat
(01:01:02 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha the chat.
(01:01:20 PM) Nick Hill: twitch.tv chat logs have got to be some weird sociological study
(01:01:37 PM) Nick Hill: HAHAHA
(01:01:46 PM) Nick Hill: people like "OMG IS THIS THE HL3 ANNOUNCEMENT!?"
(01:01:50 PM) Nick Hill: that's actually pretty hilarious
(01:02:59 PM) Dom DeStefano: Lol that's pure satire at this point.
(01:03:13 PM) Nick Hill: yeah pretty much haha
(01:03:17 PM) Dom DeStefano: HL3 is the new epic vaporware now that someone actually made Duke Nukem Forever.
(01:03:32 PM) Dom DeStefano: Which is fine, as long as Ken Levine's next project doesn't become epic vaporware too.
(01:04:24 PM) Nick Hill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRxcSNaVCPA HAHAHA this is great
(01:04:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Playing Bioshock last night and I decided to see how he was progressing with that, they're building engine and talking about narrative structures. They have to make the protagonist fully customizable in every way, they have to record all voice acting in small, modular snippets...
(01:04:50 PM) Dom DeStefano: No more mo-cap or AI run NPCs like Elizabeth though.
(01:05:12 PM) Dom DeStefano: Because his next gaming project is a video game with a procedurally generated story arc.
(01:05:19 PM) Nick Hill: ohhhhh snap
(01:05:33 PM) Dom DeStefano: It'll literally be different every time.
(01:06:17 PM) Nick Hill: oh it's starrting!
(01:06:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Let me know what it is!
(01:06:40 PM) Dom DeStefano: Can't follow the stream.
(01:06:47 PM) Nick Hill: word will do
(01:09:42 PM) Nick Hill: "we're able to finally deliver on the dream of VR"
(01:09:52 PM) Nick Hill: nothing has been shown yet
(01:10:08 PM) Nick Hill: "and it is finally here, this is the beginning of VR gaming"
(01:10:11 PM) Nick Hill: annnd here comes the unveiling
(01:10:12 PM) Nick Hill: :o

(01:19:16 PM) Dom DeStefano: Dude this show is the Wachowskis best thing since the first Matrix.
(01:19:23 PM) Nick Hill: ohhh the controller design that got 'leaked' isn't just a remote....
(01:19:31 PM) Nick Hill: there's an included gamepad....
(01:19:56 PM) Nick Hill: oh nevermind Lol
(01:20:03 PM) Nick Hill: "Included xbox one controller & wireless adapter"
(01:20:05 PM) Nick Hill: BUT that's awesome.
(01:20:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: I kinda want this series to be a video game...

(01:22:41 PM) Nick Hill: I don't know much aboutg it
(01:22:45 PM) Nick Hill: I will upgrade to learn it though
(01:22:47 PM) Nick Hill: and it's free so why not
(01:23:07 PM) Dom DeStefano: Even if it's not *awesome* per se, getting it on every platform will be good for maintenance and make software and driver development easier.
(01:23:27 PM) Nick Hill: oh wow july 29 for windows 10
(01:23:30 PM) Nick Hill: that's sooner than I expected
(01:23:34 PM) Dom DeStefano: Yeah man.
(01:23:44 PM) Dom DeStefano: Did you hear about people seeing the icon to upgrade on their system tray?
(01:23:52 PM) Nick Hill: oh yeah
(01:23:55 PM) Nick Hill: I did not get that yet lol
(01:24:03 PM) Nick Hill: I'm going into microsoft now to see if I can "preupgrade" or what not
(01:24:08 PM) Dom DeStefano: Me neither.
(01:25:20 PM) Nick Hill: I bought two windows 8.1 licenses
(01:25:22 PM) Nick Hill: for me and racahel

(01:28:51 PM) Nick Hill: it's released digitally now! it's so easy.
(01:28:53 PM) Nick Hill: hahahaha
(01:29:03 PM) Dom DeStefano: Fortunately Windows 10 will be free even to unauthenticated users like me.
(01:29:09 PM) Nick Hill: it's an effort to value equation
(01:29:39 PM) Nick Hill: it's worth ~$100 to not ever have to deal with random "HAHA your shit's not actually authenticated anymore! Have fun!"
(01:30:44 PM) Nick Hill: ohh eve valkyrie trailer
(01:30:56 PM) Nick Hill: another VR space shooter

(01:51:54 PM) Nick Hill: "hand presence"
(01:52:21 PM) Nick Hill: kind of like razer hydra
(01:57:42 PM) Nick Hill: has sensors that can sense hand movements
(01:57:56 PM) Nick Hill: so if you point or wave or thumbs up or middle finger, it can translate that in game
(01:57:57 PM) Nick Hill: haaaa

(01:58:59 PM) Nick Hill: I had to double check what subreddit that was in.
(01:59:31 PM) Nick Hill: "Scientists changed the name of that planet in 2035 to end that joke forever!"
(01:59:34 PM) Nick Hill: What did they name it?
(01:59:36 PM) Nick Hill: Urectum!

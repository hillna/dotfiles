(12:46:49 PM) Shelby Reyes: Haha yeah, sheshechan
(12:47:10 PM) Shelby Reyes: I haven't had time to do too much with my computer recently, I've been busy
(12:47:58 PM) Shelby Reyes: I'm actually a little concerned after running Prime95 over night my processor is running about 98 degrees celcius
(12:48:27 PM) Shelby Reyes: I used the fan that came with the CPU so I might just get a better one
(12:49:03 PM) Shelby Reyes: Also I got a hand-me-down hard drive that isn't working so I need to get a new one
(12:49:35 PM) Shelby Reyes: Also.... I'm having a strange issue where when I install the video card driver it cuts off either side of the screen into black bars
(12:49:48 PM) Shelby Reyes: but when I uninstall it it works fine
(12:49:56 PM) Shelby Reyes: so I've got a bit of work to do still :P
(12:54:48 PM) Nick Hill: yikes 98 C is _really high_
(12:54:56 PM) Nick Hill: it might not be a fan issue if it's running that hot
(12:55:40 PM) Nick Hill: make sure that the thermal paste layer is _thin as hair_, has no stickers or anything on the surfaces of CPU/Cooler (sorry to be so "obvious" but I've seen that mistake so many imtes), and that the cooler is fully mounted and secure
(12:55:46 PM) Nick Hill: you should be seeing temps in the 60s
(12:56:24 PM) Nick Hill: the CPU will actually shut itself off at 105C as that's over temp
(12:56:54 PM) Nick Hill: it sounds more like a problem than an underperforming stock fan
(12:57:02 PM) Nick Hill: and I'm not sure upgrading will fix it (and will cost money)
(12:57:20 PM) Shelby Reyes: mhm
(12:57:26 PM) Nick Hill: too much thermal paste actually acts as an insulator, since it's silicon based
(12:57:35 PM) Shelby Reyes: I'll clean off the thermal paste and try again
(12:57:43 PM) Shelby Reyes: thanks for the tip!
(12:58:26 PM) Nick Hill: to apply the paste, you want to "wax" it into the heat sink surface, then wipe off excess - you want it to look like "foggy copper"
(12:58:36 PM) Nick Hill: the paste sehould only fill the imperfections there, to make a perfect smooth surface
(12:58:51 PM) Nick Hill: then on the CPU you want to put a glob down, then use a credit card to spread it around
(12:58:59 PM) Nick Hill: you want  it as thin as possible while remaining opaque
(12:59:11 PM) Nick Hill: smooth is a bonus, but not 100% necessary
(12:59:28 PM) Nick Hill: it'st one of those less is more things - it's only really meant to fill in microscopic imperfections in the metalic surfaces
(01:00:10 PM) Nick Hill: if I were to guess, though, not actually being there, it sounds like the heatsink isn't fully clamped down
(01:00:14 PM) Nick Hill: to get that high of a temp
(01:00:29 PM) Nick Hill: You don't have the computer in a cubby hole or anything, do you? It has air flow?
(01:00:41 PM) Nick Hill: (let mek now if I'm jabbering your ear off, too. I just like computers -_-(
(01:01:26 PM) Shelby Reyes: no no it's really helpful to figure out what's wrong
(01:01:33 PM) Shelby Reyes: It's sitting beside my desk so yeah, it has airflow
(01:01:38 PM) Nick Hill: ok cool
(01:01:49 PM) Nick Hill: yeah you should see much lower temps than that.
(01:12:46 PM) Shelby Reyes: I'll probably take care of it tomorrow
(01:13:03 PM) Shelby Reyes: my new hard drive is coming tomorrow plus I need to install my card reader
(01:13:12 PM) Nick Hill: sweet :)
(01:13:46 PM) Shelby Reyes: any idea of what could be wrong with the video card driver?
(01:14:06 PM) Shelby Reyes: tried googling the problem and I couldn't find anyone else that had the same problem
(01:14:19 PM) Nick Hill: hmm I missed that part, what's the problem?
(01:15:48 PM) Shelby Reyes: when I install the driver, the edges of the screen get cut off and there are black bars on either side
(01:16:05 PM) Shelby Reyes: also it's cut off on the left side of the screen only, but still centered
(01:16:14 PM) Shelby Reyes: like I can see the date and time on the bottom right
(01:16:24 PM) Shelby Reyes: but most of my task bar icons get cut off
(01:16:35 PM) Shelby Reyes: I can take a photo later to show you
(01:16:47 PM) Shelby Reyes: I uninstalled the driver for now
(01:18:43 PM) Nick Hill: oh hm sounds like the monitor might need adjusting
(01:18:48 PM) Nick Hill: what kind of cable are you hooking it up with?
(01:19:10 PM) Nick Hill: Also in windows display properties, or maybe in the nvidia properties (I forget which) you can adjust the screen placement, scaling, etc.
(01:21:13 PM) Nick Hill: also what kind of monitor?
(01:24:56 PM) Shelby Reyes: 24" LG Flatron L246WP
(01:25:13 PM) Shelby Reyes: and VGA
(01:26:28 PM) Shelby Reyes: I mean, I tried it with HDMI too
(01:27:00 PM) Shelby Reyes: Like right now I have a VGA > HDMI
(01:27:08 PM) Shelby Reyes: but I also tried HDMI > HDMI with the same results
(01:27:26 PM) Shelby Reyes: yeah, I know
(01:27:34 PM) Shelby Reyes: oh god sorry I meant DVI
(01:27:58 PM) Shelby Reyes: mk
(01:28:11 PM) Shelby Reyes: right
(01:28:46 PM) Shelby Reyes: don't think so, this is the exact same monitor and video card Sam handed down to me
(01:28:49 PM) Shelby Reyes: he used the same combo
(01:29:14 PM) Nick Hill: Right but you have to initially set the resolution
(01:29:23 PM) Nick Hill: it defaults to a "safe' resolution
(01:29:36 PM) Nick Hill: which might be a different aspect ratio than your monitor, hence the bars
(01:29:58 PM) Nick Hill: (If I'm imagining what you're describing properly)
(01:30:31 PM) Shelby Reyes: I tried all different resolutions
(01:32:43 PM) Shelby Reyes: Mmkays
(01:35:05 PM) Shelby Reyes: I don't think I'm ready for that, haha
(01:35:17 PM) Nick Hill: hahaha it's cool, I'm mostly joking 
(01:35:23 PM) Nick Hill: but that's how you really learn how a computer works

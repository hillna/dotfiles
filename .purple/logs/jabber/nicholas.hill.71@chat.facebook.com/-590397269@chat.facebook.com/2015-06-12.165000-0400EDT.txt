(04:50:00 PM) Shelby Reyes: I just closed Prime95 and it instantly dropped to 60 degrees c
(04:50:44 PM) Nick Hill: yeah it's still a little high, but not terribly abnormal
(04:51:12 PM) Nick Hill: you said these were hand me down? The cooler might just be dirty/fan not as efficient, etc.
(04:51:20 PM) Nick Hill: but sttill worth checking the other stuff :)
(04:52:36 PM) Shelby Reyes: Yeah, they were brand new when Sam got them 4 years ago
(04:53:05 PM) Shelby Reyes: I used rubbing alcohol to clean off the old thermal compound and used canned air and dust cloths to get all the old gunk off them
(04:53:14 PM) Nick Hill: nice
(04:53:29 PM) Nick Hill: yeah if remounting it doesn't help, and everything looks OK, an upgraded cooler should do it
(04:53:54 PM) Nick Hill: I was forgetting the CPU was older and under prime 95 load- newer gen ones run cooler
(04:54:17 PM) Shelby Reyes: cool thanks!

(02:25:06 PM) Nick Hill: I should be around later to help troubleshoot
(02:25:09 PM) Nick Hill: basically this is what we're going to do:
(02:25:11 PM) Nick Hill: Tear it all apart
(02:25:13 PM) Nick Hill: and rebuild it
(02:25:14 PM) Nick Hill: with my guidance
(02:25:35 PM) Nick Hill: and test each step of the way

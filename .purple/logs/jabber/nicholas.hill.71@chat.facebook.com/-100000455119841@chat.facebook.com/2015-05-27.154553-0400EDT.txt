(03:45:53 PM) Nick Santangelo: i want to say they said it would be more than the cost of a games console
(03:46:39 PM) Nick Santangelo: wait. that was hololens http://venturebeat.com/2015/05/01/microsofts-hololens-will-cost-more-than-your-xbox-one-or-playstation-4/
(03:53:56 PM) Nick Santangelo: i think ps4 and xbox one are 400
(03:54:55 PM) Nick Santangelo: sounds like rift will be at least 300 http://www.gamespot.com/articles/oculus-rift-will-cost-more-than-200-how-much-would/1100-6427208/
(03:55:15 PM) Nick Santangelo: yeah
(03:55:20 PM) Nick Santangelo: but no telling how much more than that it will be
(03:55:35 PM) Nick Santangelo: morpheus doesn't have a price. sony won't even say if it's actually going to release it or not
(03:55:55 PM) Nick Santangelo: and then there is the valve vive
(03:57:31 PM) Nick Santangelo: sounds like maybe 400-500 for vive http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/htc-exec-expect-a-slightly-higher-price-point-for-valves-vive-vr/
(03:57:37 PM) Nick Santangelo: and 200-400 for rift
(03:57:50 PM) Nick Santangelo: steam machines are a flop
(03:57:58 PM) Nick Santangelo: i thought the first one came out already
(03:58:02 PM) Nick Santangelo: but i could be wrong
(03:58:55 PM) Nick Santangelo: i'm wrong. first ones out in november
(03:59:19 PM) Nick Santangelo: that sounds pretty serious
(03:59:55 PM) Nick Santangelo: you don't say
(04:00:05 PM) Nick Santangelo: :P
(04:00:57 PM) Nick Santangelo: i mean, i think space is cool as shit, but i'm not about to build a cockpit, haha. still, i think it's cool that you might
(04:32:09 PM) Nick Santangelo: that's dedication
(04:38:24 PM) Nick Santangelo: i dont' know much about star citizen, but that sounds like it would be killer in occulus
(04:55:46 PM) Nick Santangelo: unfortunately for you, it's probably always going to be fairly niche
(04:56:04 PM) Nick Santangelo: but hopefully vr gives some boost. i'm stil lworried VR won't really take off beyond the crazies (myself included), though
(04:56:08 PM) Nick Santangelo: haha
(04:56:13 PM) Nick Santangelo: yeah, a bit, right?
(04:59:54 PM) Nick Santangelo: "some fucker in poland"
(04:59:56 PM) Nick Santangelo: LMAO
(05:13:06 PM) Nick Santangelo: sony jus said morpheus will be out in the first half of 2016
(05:13:11 PM) Nick Santangelo: didn't give a price
(05:42:20 PM) Nick Santangelo: rift is sometime in 2016
(05:42:33 PM) Nick Santangelo: not sure if they've narrowed it down further than that
(08:30:25 PM) Nick Santangelo: Nick sent an attachment.

(09:16:41 PM) Nick Santangelo: Mac people
(09:17:15 PM) Nick Santangelo: I know a few gamers who love the idea of occulus  but who are mac fan boys and don't have pcs. Then again, they're probably not getting a PC no matter what
(09:53:13 PM) Nick Santangelo: Really?
(09:53:39 PM) Nick Santangelo: Most mac owners aren't playing high end game a on their computers, though
(09:53:43 PM) Nick Santangelo: Even if they're gamers
(09:55:05 PM) Nick Santangelo: I've always felt like mac software isn't different enough from windows to be put on some sort of holy pedestal. And I don't even know all that much about its capabilites because I've never been a mac guy. Eve th one says it's great for artists and photographers and such. Maybe it is. Buy the basics of it seem really fucking similar
(09:55:34 PM) Nick Santangelo: Just with minor changes. Many of which seem real fucking dumb to me, but I acknowledge that might just be because I'm not used to them
(09:55:59 PM) Nick Santangelo: Why does direct x make a dofderence? Is it a Microsoft product?
(10:03:44 PM) Nick Santangelo: Gotcha
(10:13:08 PM) Nick Santangelo: Had no idea
(10:16:22 PM) Nick Santangelo: Computer, you so krazeeee
(10:27:22 PM) Nick Santangelo: I would do that...if someone would set it up for me
(10:27:38 PM) Nick Santangelo: Because I have actually thought of doing it well before we talked about this shit
(10:27:43 PM) Nick Santangelo: But I feel like I'd fuck shit up
(10:28:56 PM) Nick Santangelo: Gotcha

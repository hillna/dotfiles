(10:51:03 AM) Nick Santangelo: after max gives like that 30-second intro in the very beginning a lot of the story you just put together by what you're shown on screen. but they do stop a few times to talk about the wives and shit
(10:51:13 AM) Nick Hill: Yeah it wasn't like
(10:51:17 AM) Nick Hill: stopped and explained
(10:51:21 AM) Nick Hill: but it felt like a living universe
(10:51:30 AM) Nick Hill: Road warriror, for instance, is fucking great
(10:51:37 AM) Nick Hill: but it's not much more than "bondage gang trying to attack fuel depo"
(10:52:01 AM) Nick Hill: you have no feeling of who that gang is, why they're there, why they're trying to get fuel, etc
(10:52:20 AM) Nick Hill: this showed the post apoc city state societies
(10:52:36 AM) Nick Hill: it felte more like a world than an event
(10:52:56 AM) Nick Hill: beyond thunderdome kind of went on to make that world, but you know
(10:52:58 AM) Nick Hill: tina turner and 1985
(10:53:01 AM) Nick Hill: yikes.
(10:54:36 AM) Nick Hill: also water.
(10:54:38 AM) Nick Hill: They mention fucking
(10:54:38 AM) Nick Hill: water
(10:54:41 AM) Nick Hill: as being important
(10:54:44 AM) Nick Hill: in the end of the world desert
(10:54:44 AM) Nick Hill: LOL
(10:55:10 AM) Nick Hill: no one givbes a shit about water in the 80s. Just diesel and nitro
(10:57:43 AM) Nick Hill: It was not only a spiritual successor, but a reinvention of the universe, and in a good way you dont often see with remakes.
(10:58:51 AM) Nick Santangelo: oh, gotcha
(10:59:03 AM) Nick Santangelo: yeah, you would think water would matter a hell of a lot more than fuel to most people
(10:59:15 AM) Nick Hill: lmfao yeah
(10:59:16 AM) Nick Hill: like
(10:59:18 AM) Nick Hill: you need the fuel
(10:59:21 AM) Nick Hill: to get far
(10:59:24 AM) Nick Hill: and FIND water and resources
(10:59:29 AM) Nick Hill: but you don't have that sense in the originals
(10:59:34 AM) Nick Hill: It's something that's up to you to assume
(10:59:52 AM) Nick Santangelo: and you see here how fuel is really a luxury that the ruling war class thinks it needs, but it's really just something that is nice for it to have. while the larger class of peasants is just concerned with getting water and surviving and doesn't give two fucks about cars or gasoline
(11:00:17 AM) Nick Santangelo: and yeah, you see the wanderers in the world looking for food and plants too
(11:00:17 AM) Nick Hill: Yeah, a LOT more like
(11:00:23 AM) Nick Hill: commentary on industry and caste and wahtnot
(11:00:43 AM) Nick Hill: also the war boy viking religion
(11:00:45 AM) Nick Hill: just ugh
(11:00:47 AM) Nick Hill: so fucking intense
(11:01:35 AM) Nick Santangelo: they really like chrome
(11:02:09 AM) Nick Hill: lmao
(11:02:11 AM) Nick Hill: yeah
(11:02:17 AM) Nick Hill: I think that chrome spray shit was also full of cocaine
(11:02:54 AM) Nick Santangelo: i also liked that some of the other field generals stopped to question immortan joe on several occasions and point out the insanity of wasting all their resources on his obsession with having an heir
(11:03:02 AM) Nick Hill: but yeah, the ritualism in death in war
(11:03:04 AM) Nick Hill: was incredible
(11:03:31 AM) Nick Hill: Yeah, I feel to like those other city states, the gas town and amm ofarm 
(11:03:32 AM) Nick Hill: were like
(11:03:35 AM) Nick Hill: under his boot heel in a way
(11:03:39 AM) Nick Hill: a very tennuous alliance
(11:03:46 AM) Nick Hill: he has the water. They have the ammo. They have the gas.
(11:04:09 AM) Nick Hill: but that's exactly what I'm talking about in that they built a world
(11:04:39 AM) Nick Hill: also
(11:04:42 AM) Nick Hill: fucking LOVED how it was like
(11:05:07 AM) Nick Hill: "30 secons of intro, then an _HOUR_ of escalating action, almost non stop, before calming down again
(11:05:36 AM) Nick Santangelo: pretty much
(11:05:49 AM) Nick Santangelo: max sure doesn't talk much
(11:05:52 AM) Nick Hill: nope haha
(11:05:54 AM) Nick Hill: never did
(11:06:08 AM) Nick Hill: he is almost a side character
(11:06:23 AM) Nick Hill: an observer in someone else's war
(11:06:40 AM) Nick Hill: I loved how they didn't make him super hero save the day type of guy
(11:06:41 AM) Nick Santangelo: kind of ridiculous that he just leaves behind water and food to wander back out into the desert, but i get that that's like kind of his thing to wander. still, you'd think he'd like, fill a canteen or something first at least
(11:06:50 AM) Nick Hill: They may have been just as successful without him
(11:06:57 AM) Nick Hill: LOL
(11:06:59 AM) Nick Hill: yeah
(11:07:14 AM) Nick Hill: he was redeemed
(11:07:42 AM) Nick Hill: part of  me hopes for sequels
(11:08:36 AM) Nick Hill: need to see it again
(11:08:38 AM) Nick Hill: Those rigs.
(11:08:40 AM) Nick Hill: So fucking aweosme
(11:08:47 AM) Nick Hill: OH also max's car that gets FUCKED like
(11:08:48 AM) Nick Hill: right off the ba
(11:08:49 AM) Nick Hill: t
(11:08:53 AM) Nick Hill: best throw back ever.
(11:09:56 AM) Nick Hill: OH ALSO
(11:09:58 AM) Nick Hill: the AUDIO
(11:09:59 AM) Nick Hill: fucking
(11:10:04 AM) Nick Hill: I have never been so impressed by audio in a movie.
(11:10:22 AM) Nick Hill: I have never thought thatt you MUST SEE THIS IN THEATERS FOR THE SOUND SYSTEM
(11:10:25 AM) Nick Hill: about anything before.
(11:10:46 AM) Nick Hill: like, instinctively ducked when he started shooting that glock next to her head
(11:10:53 AM) Nick Hill: OH
(11:10:56 AM) Nick Hill: and the mechanics of the firearm
(11:10:57 AM) Nick Hill: UGH
(11:11:04 AM) Nick Hill: FINALLY SOMEONE PAS ATTENTION TO HOW A GUN WORKS
(11:12:16 AM) Nick Hill: yeah.
(11:12:18 AM) Nick Hill: I like mad max.
(11:12:19 AM) Nick Hill: a lotl.
(11:12:21 AM) Nick Hill: LOL
(11:12:30 AM) Nick Hill: but what I mean by how the originals where such a big deal to me
(11:12:36 AM) Nick Hill: they were my first perception of like
(11:12:53 AM) Nick Hill: luxurious western society and all is a very thin edge
(11:14:09 AM) Nick Hill: I wouldn't have given a crap about the Fallout series were it not for mad max, type of thing
(11:19:27 AM) Nick Santangelo: i kept thinking throughout that the single shoulder pads that both max and furiota or whatever her name was were wearing made them look like the lone wanderer
(11:19:43 AM) Nick Hill: the lone wanderer took like
(11:19:50 AM) Nick Hill: 90% of its character influence from max.
(11:19:57 AM) Nick Hill: It was SO MUCH MORE apparent in Fallotu and Fallout 2
(11:20:04 AM) Nick Hill: like, no mad max, no fallout
(11:20:05 AM) Nick Hill: literally.
(11:20:19 AM) Nick Hill: in 2, ther'es a dog "dogmeat" that is an homage to Max's dog
(11:20:30 AM) Nick Santangelo: but i guess i have to wonder how much fallout was inspired by the original max movies. it's probably more likely that fallout pulled stuff from them and i just don't realize it because i never really watched the
(11:20:40 AM) Nick Hill: yeah literally wouldn't exist without them
(11:20:58 AM) Nick Santangelo: i never played the first two
(11:21:01 AM) Nick Hill: oh man
(11:21:02 AM) Nick Hill: like
(11:21:06 AM) Nick Hill: fallout 3+ were amazing
(11:21:06 AM) Nick Santangelo: just 3 and vegas
(11:21:13 AM) Nick Hill: but nothing ccompared to fallout 2
(11:21:19 AM) Nick Hill: but also totally differnet styles of games, etc
(11:21:28 AM) Nick Santangelo: looks like it from what i've seen
(11:21:29 AM) Nick Hill: like all the tongue in cheekdark humor of 3 and las vegas?
(11:21:34 AM) Nick Hill: was a watered down version of the originals
(11:21:48 AM) Nick Hill: They were isomorphic turn based adventure games
(11:21:51 AM) Nick Hill: totally different formats
(11:21:57 AM) Nick Hill: but incredible stories, amazing worlds, etc.
(11:22:07 AM) Nick Hill: They were the kind of game that was impossible to see everything in a single play through
(11:23:05 AM) Nick Hill: the whole like
(11:23:07 AM) Nick Hill: scrap punk style
(11:23:12 AM) Nick Hill: mad max.
(11:23:24 AM) Nick Santangelo: yeah, that was well before my pc gaming days...though i did play warcraft 1 & 2 back in the day on pc

(11:23:44 AM) Nick Santangelo: but fallout 3 was the first i played of the series
(11:23:49 AM) Nick Hill: You'd think this was soemthing _straight_ out of fallout
(11:23:51 AM) Nick Santangelo: really liked it, but i've always liked elder scrolls more
(11:23:54 AM) Nick Hill: that's road warrior :D
(11:24:05 AM) Nick Hill: Yeah I'm way more into post apocalypse stuff than fantasy stuff
(11:24:08 AM) Nick Hill: so I have the opposite there
(11:24:13 AM) Nick Hill: the whole thing of like
(11:24:15 AM) Nick Hill: "possibilty vs fantasy"
(11:24:17 AM) Nick Santangelo: oh man. love the football pads
(11:24:19 AM) Nick Hill: or whatever
(11:24:22 AM) Nick Santangelo: and it does look like fallout
(11:24:24 AM) Nick Hill: Hey man it's effective armor :D
(11:24:28 AM) Nick Hill: when you've got scrap to work with
(11:24:37 AM) Nick Santangelo: better than nothing
(11:24:39 AM) Nick Hill: exactly

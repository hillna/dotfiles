(04:24:56 PM) Nick Santangelo: from what i'd heard from some devs working on VR games, it sounded like they were under the impression this thing would be out in 2015. but from what i've seen of it out of microsoft, that just doesn't sound feasible. it looks to me like it's still way too early in the dev cycle for that
(04:25:22 PM) Nick Hill: yeah seriously
(04:25:27 PM) Nick Hill: unless they've had it under extreme wraps for years
(04:25:34 PM) Nick Hill: (which I wouldn'dt put past a company like MS to be able to do)
(04:31:16 PM) Nick Santangelo: they probably have, but from what journalists are saying it's like right now, it sounds like there is a lot of work to be done before it's production ready
(04:31:36 PM) Nick Santangelo: but maybe they'll just throw a gazillion people and dollars at that problem to make it go away, haha
(04:33:20 PM) Nick Hill: lmao
(04:33:21 PM) Nick Hill: or
(04:33:29 PM) Nick Hill: they'll just ship it full of issues in classic microsoft style
(04:33:41 PM) Nick Hill: "we'll have a service pack in 2 months"
(04:46:13 PM) Nick Santangelo: I really hope not
(04:46:21 PM) Nick Santangelo: But that would be in keeping with history
(04:46:51 PM) Nick Hill: haha yeah I mean
(04:46:53 PM) Nick Hill: would you be surprised?
(04:47:35 PM) Nick Hill: basically I'm just trying to crush my own hopes to soften the blow of the inevitable disapointment. 
(05:01:03 PM) Nick Santangelo: LOL

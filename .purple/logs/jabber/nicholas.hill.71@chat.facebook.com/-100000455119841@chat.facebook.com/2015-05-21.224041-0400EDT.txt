(10:40:41 PM) Nick Santangelo: I have it on xbox 360
(12:13:31 AM) Nick Santangelo: It was one multiplatform release that was worth it to get on console for me. I wasn't going to wait two years or whatever it ended up being for it to finally make it to pc
(12:14:12 AM) Nick Santangelo: But I probably buy like 8 out of 10 multiplatform games on pc
(12:14:18 AM) Nick Santangelo: Haha, ok
(12:16:13 AM) Nick Santangelo: Cool. I rarely buy games twice. I just know I'll never get around to spending time with them
(12:16:26 AM) Nick Santangelo: I have too many games I barely play or haven't gotten around to playing at all as is
(12:16:32 AM) Nick Santangelo: It's a problem
(12:16:35 AM) Nick Santangelo: Lol
(12:17:56 AM) Nick Santangelo: We have all th see kids in their early 20s with no real jobs writing for xbla fans now, and these motherfucker literally play every single id @xbox release that comes out and get every fucking achievement and look at me like I'm crazy when I get like one or two new games a month outside of steam sales and the November rush
(12:20:32 AM) Nick Santangelo: Exactly
(12:20:48 AM) Nick Santangelo: And won't lie, I was kind of like that in my early 20s
(12:21:03 AM) Nick Santangelo: Not quote as obsessive as these kids are. But close
(12:27:47 AM) Nick Santangelo: I didn't move out until I was 29
(12:27:49 AM) Nick Santangelo: Lol
(12:29:56 AM) Nick Santangelo: Good for you though that you took that on and supported yourself and got through it
(12:30:01 AM) Nick Santangelo: Probably a good life experience
(12:30:07 AM) Nick Santangelo: I have one sister
(12:30:14 AM) Nick Santangelo: She's getting married next weekend actually
(12:31:31 AM) Nick Santangelo: That's funny
(12:31:33 AM) Nick Santangelo: Thanks man
(12:31:58 AM) Nick Santangelo: Yeah, I went to holy family for programming at 18. Dropped out after two years and had no fucking clue what to do wi th my life
(12:32:13 AM) Nick Santangelo: So I stayed home and worked at th e postal service for four years
(12:32:52 AM) Nick Santangelo: Got a career position there and left after six months of that, realizing life was pretty much never getting better than that
(12:33:03 AM) Nick Santangelo: So I was at Camden county for a year and working at gamestop
(12:33:10 AM) Nick Santangelo: Then Rutgers for another two years
(12:33:24 AM) Nick Santangelo: Then took me a year after graduation to get a real job because of the recession
(12:33:38 AM) Nick Santangelo: Then a yea after that before I had a real job that paid a livable salary, lol
(12:33:48 AM) Nick Santangelo: So I fucked up my 20s. But I figured shit out eventually
(12:34:28 AM) Nick Santangelo: Haha
(12:34:41 AM) Nick Santangelo: You didn't graduate from drexel?
(12:35:37 AM) Nick Santangelo: My manager at work is 26, so I see how fucking up my 20s held me back, and I'm playing catchup. But oh well, got 35+ years to have a real career still
(12:35:58 AM) Nick Santangelo: Haha about the heroin
(12:36:02 AM) Nick Santangelo: That'll fuck shit up
(12:36:12 AM) Nick Santangelo: Yeah, school was tough for me too. So I can relate
(12:37:18 AM) Nick Santangelo: Sorry to hear that, man
(12:37:22 AM) Nick Santangelo: All right. Night

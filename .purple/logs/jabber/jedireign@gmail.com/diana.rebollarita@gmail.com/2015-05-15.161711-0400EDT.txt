(04:50:06 PM) Diana Montoya: same with china
(04:50:10 PM) jedireign: I knew they hated the japanese, didn't really knjow why
(04:50:17 PM) Diana Montoya: haha yeahhh that's why
(04:50:17 PM) jedireign: figured it's because pre-WWII japanese were literally the worst people ever
(04:50:41 PM) jedireign: well pre vj day
(04:50:44 PM) Diana Montoya: the whole thing leading up to the rapid militarization of japan is interesting

(04:52:48 PM) Diana Montoya: they were in isolation for centuries
(04:52:54 PM) Diana Montoya: anyway after that japan was like "oh shit"

(04:53:05 PM) Diana Montoya: colonizing everyone
(04:53:08 PM) Diana Montoya: and they didn't want to be colonized
(04:53:13 PM) Diana Montoya: so they realized they had to catch up to the modern world
(04:53:21 PM) Diana Montoya: so they modernized eeextremely fast
(04:53:26 PM) Diana Montoya: and they realized it was "conquer, or be conquered"
(04:53:32 PM) Diana Montoya: that was the mindset leading up to 1942
(04:53:51 PM) Diana Montoya: a lot like manifest destiny, and desperation to not be taken over as a small island nation
(04:54:11 PM) jedireign: apparnetly, that was going on though in the 1500s with  korea

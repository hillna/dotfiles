(09:45:54 AM) jedireign: not bad, how bout you mang?
(09:46:59 AM) Alex Finger: Doin' alright I guess
(09:47:05 AM) Alex Finger: How's the job and all that?
(09:48:32 AM) jedireign: pretty good
(09:48:42 AM) jedireign: we just changed from monthly to biweekly pay that has me all effed up
(09:49:28 AM) Alex Finger: Ah. Well... that's probably better in the long run right?
(09:54:32 AM) jedireign: eh not really
(09:54:45 AM) jedireign: it makes it more of a balancing game, because all of my bills are due within the first week, and the rest is very well budgeteted
(09:54:55 AM) jedireign: stil paycheck to paycheck, but comfortably
(09:55:02 AM) jedireign: well until now lol
(09:55:14 AM) jedireign: luckily I paid a buncvh of extra shit last month so my stuff due has zero balance
(09:55:23 AM) jedireign: so hoping to just keep that rythem going and pay them pre-due on second check
(09:55:26 AM) jedireign: BILLZLZZZZ
(09:56:06 AM) Alex Finger: Maybe you could request keeping a monthly schedule
(09:56:16 AM) jedireign: yeah I'm goinmg to talk to HR
(09:56:17 AM) jedireign: thing is like
(09:56:23 AM) Alex Finger: I don't know if that would be doable but it doesn't seem to be an unreasonable request
(09:56:29 AM) jedireign: we went from monthly to biweekly because "It's easier for our two part timers payroll processing"
(09:56:41 AM) jedireign: I donm't get how it makes it easier to process  2 people when 35 people now need to be processed twice a month

(11:08:15 AM) Dan Lynn: I'm very sad that halo's gameplay is one I rank barely over dating/sex sims because the lore is awesome
(11:12:16 AM) jedireign: http://venom.crowdstrike.com/
(11:12:21 AM) jedireign: another week anotehr xen vulnerability
(11:12:36 AM) jedireign: guess who gets to stay up overnight to fix it!
(11:13:28 AM) Dan Lynn: is this another one of those things where we forget that in virtual machines, a virtual container is not physically separate from other virtual containers?
(11:13:37 AM) Dan Lynn: like the graphics driver hack for vmware?
(11:13:44 AM) jedireign: exactly
(11:13:53 AM) jedireign: only this vulnerability permits host level escalation
(11:13:56 AM) jedireign: which is super dangerous
(11:14:05 AM) Dan Lynn: yup
(11:14:06 AM) Dan Lynn: nice
(11:14:08 AM) jedireign: infect the vm host, own the network
(11:14:11 AM) jedireign: save the cheerleader, save the world
(11:14:31 AM) jedireign: It's funny how patterns of words can bring up shit you haven't thought about in forever.
(11:14:40 AM) Dan Lynn: slight tangent, but do you know who Ron Jeffries and Chet Hendrickson are?
(11:14:57 AM) jedireign: I do not
(11:15:31 AM) Dan Lynn: big XP guys, they, along with bob martin, really bash on agile for leaving programming behind
(11:15:55 AM) jedireign: not familiar with XP
(11:15:58 AM) jedireign: other than that filthy OS
(11:16:23 AM) Dan Lynn: had a nice conversation with them last week about engineering practices and how somewhere, people really need to start paying attention to how we code. This just really reminded me of that
(11:16:32 AM) Dan Lynn: XP = Extreme Programming
(11:16:41 AM) jedireign: yeah went down the wiki hole a bit
(11:16:46 AM) Dan Lynn: if people ever talk about agile technical practices, they probably mean XP
(11:20:17 AM) Dan Lynn: so, in agile, we have this idea of doing things simply - just enough to get the job done. In old agile and XP, there was still this idea of doing the work right, so it kinda balanced out, but in the past decade, agile has lost the technical side, so now doing enough to get the job done is starting to mean half-assing programming.
(11:21:14 AM) Dan Lynn: and this is kinda the perfect example. The virtual machine is handling drives perfectly, but it's not programmed right, so you have a horrid vulnerability
(11:21:33 AM) jedireign: ah I gotcha, yeah
(11:21:44 AM) jedireign: favoring shipitshipitshipit over code quality
(11:22:02 AM) jedireign: because as much as you say you're going to go back and fix those # TODO: comments
(11:22:03 AM) jedireign: ...
(11:22:04 AM) jedireign: you never do.
(11:22:26 AM) Dan Lynn: you know how many tables in Hosting's DB are named TEMPORARY[Something]?
(11:22:31 AM) jedireign: lmfao
(11:26:21 AM) Dan Lynn: but yeah, it's like prepping a board for carpentry. If you don't saw it all evently and plane it down and cut the dovetails cleanly, it'll still nail to the other piece of wood, but don't expect it to look good, or hold up, or be watertight, or anything else
(11:26:33 AM) Dan Lynn: and yeah, it's faster, but you pay for that
(11:26:37 AM) jedireign: fucking dovetails
(11:26:39 AM) jedireign: meticulous as fuck
(11:26:44 AM) Dan Lynn: haha
(11:27:05 AM) jedireign: haha I want to learn to work with wood so bad
(11:27:06 AM) jedireign: but just
(11:27:06 AM) jedireign: no
(11:27:07 AM) jedireign: fucking
(11:27:08 AM) jedireign: room
(11:27:13 AM) jedireign: there are hacker space type wood shop places
(11:27:14 AM) Dan Lynn: yeah, seriously
(11:27:15 AM) jedireign: but so expensive
(11:27:28 AM) jedireign: I could buy a table saw for what ait would cost for 2 months of membership, type of thing
(11:27:33 AM) Dan Lynn: did you see the treasure chests I did for the girls?
(11:27:37 AM) jedireign: I did!
(11:27:56 AM) jedireign: brb
(11:27:56 AM) Dan Lynn: incidentally, that's what happens when you don't own a planer - holy shit that was aweful
(01:28:54 PM) Dan Lynn: this day is doomed
(01:30:52 PM) jedireign: productivity?
(01:30:54 PM) Dan Lynn: oh yeah
(01:30:58 PM) jedireign: yeah I'm in the same boat
(01:30:58 PM) jedireign: haha
(01:31:05 PM) Dan Lynn: I've somehow looped back to futurama
(01:31:14 PM) jedireign: Exhausted from crap for sleep, derpy weather, have some scheduled stuff later but am watching hte office on lunch right now
(01:31:24 PM) jedireign: haven't gotten much of anything done yet
(01:31:28 PM) jedireign: other than like
(01:31:29 PM) jedireign: read the email
(01:31:32 PM) jedireign: and trello
(01:31:33 PM) jedireign: lol
(01:31:38 PM) jedireign: *wednesdays*
(01:31:38 PM) Dan Lynn: haha
(01:33:04 PM) Dan Lynn: I came across this article, which may very well be the best article on computer programming ever written: http://codon.com/i-have-no-idea-what-im-doing
(01:33:17 PM) jedireign: hahahaha
(01:33:18 PM) jedireign: that title
(01:33:19 PM) jedireign: YUP
(01:33:21 PM) jedireign: sounds perfect
(01:36:16 PM) jedireign: ugh
(01:36:19 PM) jedireign: let me share a frustration
(01:36:23 PM) jedireign: when someone comes to me with a problem
(01:36:29 PM) jedireign: they shoul sday "Hey, this is failing on this"
(01:36:38 PM) jedireign: not fuccing beat around the bush vague "Should this behave like this?"
(01:37:22 PM) Dan Lynn: yup
(01:37:32 PM) Dan Lynn: or at least "I expected this, but got that"
(01:37:35 PM) jedireign: hahaha
(01:37:35 PM) jedireign: right
(01:37:39 PM) jedireign: no mention of hte affected nodes
(01:37:44 PM) jedireign: no mention of the actual faiilure
(01:37:50 PM) jedireign: just vague assumptions in confirmation
(01:37:58 PM) jedireign: and it just adds so much mental labor to the problem solving process LOL
(01:37:59 PM) jedireign: instead of being like
(01:38:07 PM) jedireign: "I can't log in to these systems I just booted up"
(01:38:09 PM) jedireign: they ccome to me
(01:38:19 PM) jedireign: "Do you know how our bootstrap process works?"
(01:38:23 PM) jedireign: frustrating.
(01:38:27 PM) jedireign: took like
(01:38:33 PM) jedireign: 10 minutes to just figure out  what was failing
(01:38:40 PM) jedireign: and it was "Oh go into cconsole and run this"
(01:38:43 PM) jedireign: is all it would have taken
(01:38:44 PM) jedireign: hahaha
(01:38:54 PM) Dan Lynn: oh, are these tickets?
(01:39:15 PM) jedireign: no, messages
(01:39:27 PM) jedireign: hipchat messages
(01:39:31 PM) jedireign: but god damn it just tell me the problem
(01:39:42 PM) jedireign: instead of like trying to assertain if I can figure out what hte problem is
(01:39:43 PM) jedireign: or something
(01:39:45 PM) jedireign: I dunno
(01:39:51 PM) jedireign:  /vent
(01:40:31 PM) Dan Lynn: haha
(01:44:25 PM) jedireign: ugh this article
(01:44:27 PM) jedireign: speaks to me so hard
(01:44:40 PM) jedireign: "I’m talking about you specifically here; you know what I’m talking about. Sometimes you think things like “I’m just making stuff up as I go along”, or “I don’t belong in this group of people”, or “I’m going to be found out”."
(01:44:48 PM) jedireign: is something I fight with every day
(01:45:10 PM) Dan Lynn: Neil Gaimon has some interesting things to say about that ... because, of course he does
(01:45:16 PM) jedireign: lol
(01:49:08 PM) jedireign: A Zen teacher (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunryu_Suzuki) said: “in the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few”.
(01:49:10 PM) jedireign: That's like the hwole
(01:49:21 PM) jedireign: The world's greatest swordsman doesn't fear the second greatest swordsman, he fears the amateur
(01:49:46 PM) Dan Lynn: haha, yeah
(01:53:02 PM) jedireign: need ot give that a more thurough read, but yeah, great fucking article
(03:20:11 PM) Dan Lynn: is it just me, or do crazy program error only come up when you're in a hurry?
(03:20:35 PM) jedireign: GOD DAMN ITG
(03:20:37 PM) jedireign: dude
(03:20:37 PM) jedireign: so
(03:20:39 PM) jedireign: two days ago
(03:20:46 PM) jedireign: blah blah bla hdeplying inconsequential shit to rfackspace
(03:20:48 PM) jedireign: la dee dah
(03:20:49 PM) jedireign: today?
(03:20:53 PM) jedireign: when important stuff needs to go out?
(03:20:56 PM) jedireign: all of the tools no longer work
(03:21:09 PM) jedireign: hahahahaha
(03:21:15 PM) jedireign: looks like we're both having one of those days
(03:21:16 PM) jedireign: LOL
(03:21:52 PM) Dan Lynn: haha
(03:22:32 PM) Dan Lynn: I've got a line of code: doodad x = new doodad(). I have a breakpoint on the closing bracket of the constructor and I see property id=1
(03:22:53 PM) Dan Lynn: click step into and I go to the line where it sets the new object to the variable, property id = 0
(03:24:49 PM) Dan Lynn: aha! figured it out. Turns out the problem is that I'm a moron (doesn't it always)
(03:26:47 PM) Dan Lynn: ambiguous variables
(03:27:47 PM) Dan Lynn: when you do that, Visual studio should give you a message like "I know this seems ok now, but in a week this is going to wreck your world".
(03:29:57 PM) jedireign: lol
(03:30:08 PM) jedireign: that's the thing about programming
(03:30:11 PM) jedireign: 99.99999999% of the time
(03:30:13 PM) jedireign: it's your fault.
(03:30:45 PM) Dan Lynn: I did public myClass(int id) {blah blah blah; id=value; blah blah blah}
(03:30:56 PM) Dan Lynn: when the class had a property of id
(03:31:46 PM) Dan Lynn: what makes it worse is I'm actually trying to use bad coding practices because I'm using this code to teach refactoring. It's just that one of the bad practices was a little too bad
(03:40:41 PM) jedireign: haha
(03:40:47 PM) jedireign: that reminds me of my college programming courses
(03:40:54 PM) jedireign: our professor would purposfully write example code with bugs
(03:40:56 PM) jedireign: we'd copy the code
(03:40:58 PM) jedireign: then ahve to debug it
(03:41:02 PM) jedireign: SO MANY PEOPLE RAGED in the class
(03:41:08 PM) jedireign: that they weren't being spoonfed the answers
(03:41:11 PM) jedireign: and that was the year I quit college
(03:41:50 PM) jedireign: great professor, though
(03:42:47 PM) jedireign: so
(03:42:50 PM) jedireign: the world is a crazy place these days
(03:42:54 PM) jedireign: you can get paid for playing video games
(03:42:57 PM) jedireign: How do I break into that shit.
(03:42:59 PM) jedireign: LOL
(03:43:04 PM) jedireign: twitch, sponerships, competative gaming
(03:43:06 PM) jedireign: it's ridiculous
(03:43:22 PM) jedireign: and by ridiculous I mean amazing and unexpected
(03:44:26 PM) jedireign: almost time for chat shift
(03:44:38 PM) jedireign: here's hoping to a nice relaxing rest of my afternoon

(10:13:13 AM) Dan Lynn: I think Jurassic World might pull a pacific rim - in the bad way
(10:13:36 AM) Dan Lynn: like take an idea that's fun regardless of the science and make the logic and science so bad it's unwatchable
(10:13:56 AM) jedireign: lmfao
(10:14:01 AM) jedireign: I did not see pacific rim
(10:14:06 AM) jedireign: (it looked pretty bad)
(10:14:22 AM) Dan Lynn: It was really bad
(10:14:51 AM) Dan Lynn: and it shouldn't have been. If they'd just have said "screw science, we have mechs and monsters" they would have been fine
(10:15:34 AM) Dan Lynn: but they had to try to be all sciency about it and failed harder than a 2nd grader explaining relativity
(10:17:51 AM) Dan Lynn: like the dude with severe radiation poisoning that was basically completely fine for decades until that one day he took a trip in a mech which inexplicably still had an unshielded nuclear reactor and that took him over some line from basically healthy to dead

(10:19:11 AM) jedireign: I been carrying this radiation poisining in me for years, man
(10:19:16 AM) jedireign: It's like atime bomb that can go off at any time!
(10:19:20 AM) jedireign: Lets hope I'm not doing something importnat
(10:19:21 AM) jedireign: OH NO

(10:21:48 AM) jedireign: I have not!
(10:22:05 AM) Dan Lynn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=373&v=YycAzdtUIko

(10:25:00 AM) jedireign: lol this dude
(10:25:06 AM) jedireign: the exasperation in his voice
(10:25:24 AM) jedireign: ok checking out space time
(10:26:08 AM) jedireign: ha woo
(10:26:16 AM) jedireign: physics is great.
(10:26:23 AM) Dan Lynn: ah, swordfish! :)
(10:26:24 AM) jedireign: I watched the particle fever documentary the other day
(10:26:30 AM) jedireign: lmfao ah swordfish
(10:26:37 AM) jedireign: You ahve to break a 256bit cipher to log in
(10:26:43 AM) jedireign: oh and it's a video game puzzle
(10:29:00 AM) Dan Lynn: I love this guy's conspiracy theory!
(10:29:22 AM) jedireign: haha yeah It's something I've heard a lot
(10:29:22 AM) jedireign: like
(10:29:26 AM) jedireign: they KNOW they're being ridiculous
(10:29:35 AM) jedireign: because it's more fun than being accurate
(10:29:41 AM) jedireign: and their target audience would be bored by accurrate
(10:29:42 AM) jedireign: fucking
(10:29:48 AM) jedireign: hacking is BORING to anyone by the keyboard jocky
(10:30:40 AM) Dan Lynn: with stuff like swordfish, jurassic park or whatever, I get it, they're trying to make it engaging. Let's face it, no one thinks hacking is exciting, even hackers
(10:31:18 AM) Dan Lynn: I'm watching the hacking done right now
(10:31:54 AM) jedireign: yeah rpetty much lol
(10:34:53 AM) Dan Lynn: I love how almost all the ones from the real hacks video are a) fairly old and b) have far less to do with computers
(10:35:35 AM) jedireign: ah link? I missed that one
(10:35:38 AM) jedireign: fuckingn
(10:35:41 AM) jedireign: antitrust
(10:35:42 AM) jedireign: of all movies
(10:35:54 AM) jedireign: had some of the most realistic terminal hax I've seen
(10:35:59 AM) Dan Lynn: it's on hackaday - "Top 10 best hacks"
(10:36:07 AM) Dan Lynn: oh yeah?
(10:36:42 AM) jedireign: yeah ti was an axtual nix terminal
(10:36:42 AM) jedireign: lol
(10:36:46 AM) jedireign: anhd text.
(10:36:53 AM) jedireign: still not great
(10:37:23 AM) jedireign: jesus I can't belivee swordfish was 14 years ago
(10:38:16 AM) Dan Lynn: I remember when I was a kid my dad had a hacking video game where you just got a console. I was 8, so I never got to figure it out, but in hindsight, it was kinda cool
(10:38:40 AM) jedireign: "movies that show nmap"
(10:38:41 AM) jedireign: lol
(10:39:16 AM) jedireign: I need to see the social network.
(10:39:43 AM) Dan Lynn: yeah, I keep debating if I feel like seeing it
(10:40:54 AM) jedireign: "and now, well, good luck finding a payphone"
(10:40:55 AM) jedireign: LOL
(10:41:00 AM) Dan Lynn: dude, seriously
(10:41:10 AM) Dan Lynn: did you ever mess with any of the phone boxes back in the day?
(10:41:21 AM) jedireign: oh yeah
(10:42:12 AM) jedireign: used to play the beigebox into "exposed" telco boxes and start conference lines and invite all my buddies
(10:42:43 AM) jedireign: I really miss analog phone networks :(
(10:42:45 AM) jedireign: they were so much fun
(10:43:00 AM) jedireign: war dialing to find BBSes and shit
(10:43:03 AM) Dan Lynn: I think it's an interesting subject because they didn't beat those people with technology - you could still use it long after it had died off - they beat them with the market. They just made phone calls such a negligible expense that the only reason to the boxes anymore was for amusement
(10:43:10 AM) Dan Lynn: ah yes, BBS's
(10:43:50 AM) jedireign: I think, maybe in the same light, it was more that it wasn't worth the expense to beat them technologically and that technology just ended up becoming obsolete
(10:43:56 AM) jedireign: but yeah red boxing and all worked well into highschool
(10:44:02 AM) jedireign: crystal modified radioshack  auto dialer
(10:44:03 AM) jedireign: aww yiss
(10:44:11 AM) jedireign: I think I still have mine laying aorund _somewhere_
(10:44:26 AM) jedireign: and then digital phone switches happened
(10:44:32 AM) jedireign: and nothing worked anymore
(10:45:00 AM) Dan Lynn: yeah, though I don't think it was until pretty recently that they finally decommissioned the last analog one
(10:45:11 AM) jedireign: Yeah I think you're rightg
(10:45:14 AM) jedireign: I seem to remember something about that
(10:47:50 AM) jedireign: "Thomas Jacob "Jack" Black first acted in a television commercial at age 13 for the 1983 video game Pitfall! by Activision."
(10:47:55 AM) jedireign: https://i.imgur.com/61twljh.gif
(10:48:09 AM) Dan Lynn: haha!
(10:51:57 AM) jedireign: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikhter_R-23
(10:52:27 AM) jedireign: "The 23R-23 cannon and its unique telescoped ammunition remained a military secret for a long time. This can be partially explained by the fact that the R-23 cannon was used in outer space, arming Soviet space stations."
(10:52:44 AM) jedireign: "Next and much more unique application found the cannon in the Soviet space program. It was mounted on the military space station ALMAZ/Salyut 3 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salyut_3)/OPS-2 as self-defence weapon. At the end of the mission, when the station flew unmanned, it was tested and successfully fired. This "space cannon" had supply of 32 rounds."
(10:56:59 AM) Dan Lynn: ok, I need to stop watching this PBS thing and get back to coding!
(11:04:35 AM) Dan Lynn: you know what the best thing about science fiction is? That sometimes the most unlikely sources are the ones who get it right
(11:04:51 AM) jedireign: how do you mean?
(11:05:01 AM) Dan Lynn: just watched a video on artificial gravity and the best, most realistic scifi franchise is Halo
(11:05:09 AM) Dan Lynn: followed very closely by babylon 5
(11:05:28 AM) jedireign: oh yeah the whole centripital force gravity?
(11:05:38 AM) Dan Lynn: yeah
(11:05:41 AM) jedireign: 2001 kinda set that stage
(11:05:55 AM) jedireign: and most people just ignore it in favor of "some kinda inexplicable toggle floor shit"
(11:06:02 AM) jedireign: that only fails when appropraite for the plot
(11:07:04 AM) Dan Lynn: apparently halo is the perfect balance in size between being large enough to minimize the differences between gravity and centripetal force and being small enough to not rip itself apart.
(11:07:27 AM) jedireign: Bungee put a LOT of work into the original halo.
(11:07:33 AM) jedireign: like over a decade of work

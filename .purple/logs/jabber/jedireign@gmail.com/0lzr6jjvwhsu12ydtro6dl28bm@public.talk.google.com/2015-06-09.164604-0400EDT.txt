(04:46:12 PM) jedireign: Hey what raspberry pi do you have retropie on?
(04:46:25 PM) jedireign: and did you overclock it or anything? does SNES performance suck for you? lol
(04:46:44 PM) jedireign: almost done scraping 4500 roms worth of metadata
(05:07:38 PM) Reuben Negron: Yea rasp pie 2
(05:07:48 PM) Reuben Negron: Over clocked to 1000mhz
(05:08:04 PM) jedireign: aren;t they default 1000MHz?
(05:08:10 PM) Reuben Negron: I bought a 50 heat sink for it and it's fine
(05:08:11 PM) jedireign: or is it a B+ overclocked?
(05:08:18 PM) jedireign: I did a "medium" overclock
(05:08:24 PM) jedireign: and it runs kinda bad
(05:08:27 PM) jedireign: I don't have a heatsink though
(05:08:29 PM) jedireign: I should get one.
(05:08:37 PM) Reuben Negron: Dunno I think a pie 2 is 900hz
(05:08:40 PM) jedireign: oh ok
(05:08:44 PM) Reuben Negron: It's stupid cheap
(05:08:45 PM) jedireign: yeah I'm on a B+
(05:08:49 PM) jedireign: I need to upgrade to a 2.
(05:08:56 PM) jedireign: I hae like 3 Bs a B+ laying around.
(05:08:56 PM) jedireign: lol
(05:09:27 PM) Reuben Negron: What version of emulation station are tou using
(05:09:30 PM) jedireign: but it's going in the car, but if I need to upgrade, I need to redo the software womp womp
(05:09:34 PM) jedireign: 2.something?
(05:09:41 PM) jedireign: whatever's installed by retropie
(05:09:54 PM) Reuben Negron: Upgrade to 3.0 through the setup
(05:10:01 PM) Reuben Negron: Is beta but it's good
(05:10:05 PM) jedireign: word I will do that 
(05:10:09 PM) jedireign: once my scraping finishes
(05:10:12 PM) Reuben Negron: Takes like an hour I'd you upgrade via binaries
(05:10:19 PM) jedireign: (and I find out where the fuck that lives and move it to the USB drive)
(05:10:40 PM) Reuben Negron: Scraping via emulation station or commanf line
(05:10:51 PM) jedireign: emulation station lol and it's taking FOREVER
(05:11:01 PM) jedireign: I just found the option in the menu like "yeah I'll do that when I go to PA!"
(05:11:07 PM) jedireign: it was _not_ done when I got back >_>
(05:11:14 PM) Reuben Negron: Dude command line takes 10 min via command line
(05:11:16 PM) jedireign: but it has like 150 left to go
(05:11:17 PM) jedireign: LOL
(05:11:18 PM) jedireign: nice
(05:11:25 PM) jedireign: emulation station is not well optimized, apparently ;)
(05:11:32 PM) jedireign: I am going to cancel that now.
(05:11:43 PM) jedireign: and upgrade emulation station
(05:12:45 PM) Reuben Negron: Yea command line is so much faster it's not 3ven funny
(05:13:16 PM) jedireign: do I need to grab a different branch of retropie-setup? or is the 3.0 upgrade in master?

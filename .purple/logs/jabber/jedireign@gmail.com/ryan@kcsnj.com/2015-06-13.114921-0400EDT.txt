(11:56:31 AM) jedireign: reading someone else who hacked it into standard case "The board is massive. It will not fit into any ‘normal’ PC case, not even an EATX tower case. The mounting screws will not mate with any of the ATX holes in a motherboard tray. The large ATX power connector is non-standard. The CPU fan headers are non-standard. There’s a separate power connector for the memory banks with a proprietary connector. The list goes on…"

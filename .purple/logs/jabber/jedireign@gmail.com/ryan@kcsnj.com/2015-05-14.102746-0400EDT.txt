(04:42:04 PM) jedireign: yeah I spent like half that
(04:42:06 PM) jedireign: I think $85
(04:43:45 PM) jedireign: http://www.bladehq.com/item--Microtech-Halo-II-2-OTF-Automatic--29079
(04:43:48 PM) jedireign: Ouch.
(04:44:02 PM) jedireign: but you know blakc market and shit, definitely illegal almost everywhere (if not federally)
(04:44:10 PM) jedireign: yoo you know what cracks me up?
(04:44:17 PM) jedireign: It's less restrictive to carry a gun than a tazer
(04:44:18 PM) jedireign: Lol
(04:44:34 PM) jedireign: (at least in MI)
(04:45:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: haha
(04:45:37 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah I like knives with straight blades
(04:45:42 PM) jedireign: serrations are useless
(04:45:45 PM) jedireign: unless you're cutting bread.
(04:45:46 PM) Ryan Nealy: the tooth ceraded
(04:45:49 PM) jedireign: or tomatos with a dull ass knife.
(04:45:49 PM) Ryan Nealy: no idea how to spell that
(04:45:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah rope
(04:45:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: is the only thing it's really good for
(04:46:00 PM) jedireign: nah not even
(04:46:05 PM) jedireign: a straight blade will be easier for rope
(04:46:11 PM) jedireign: serrations are good for "hard exterior, soft interior"
(04:46:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: it depends on the situation 
(04:46:17 PM) jedireign: and how sharp your knife is
(04:46:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: when I used my knife daily
(04:46:26 PM) jedireign: serrations are great compared to a dull knife
(04:46:33 PM) Ryan Nealy: it was hard to keep it sharp enough to cut rope that was big, easily
(04:46:37 PM) jedireign: Yeah
(04:46:39 PM) jedireign: need better steel
(04:46:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: they would fall off in the water and shit all the time so
(04:46:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: I would use it ALL day
(04:46:57 PM) jedireign: lolyeah there's your tradeoff
(04:46:57 PM) Ryan Nealy: everyday
(04:47:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: if you had something to cut against
(04:47:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: aka a tree or something
(04:47:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: you put the rope against it and np
(04:47:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: but if you didn't, like in the water
(04:47:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: it was way easier with serraded
(04:47:23 PM) jedireign: soft steel and sharpen it every day (which is easy on soft steel) or hard steel and sharpen it evbery so often (but is tough as shit)
(04:47:29 PM) jedireign: yeah that's a good application, though
(04:47:37 PM) jedireign: a knife you beat to shit but need to cut rope and don't care if it goes into the drink
(04:47:40 PM) jedireign: good steel is $$$
(04:47:50 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah I usually had 10 dollar limit on kinves
(04:47:55 PM) jedireign: lol yeah
(04:47:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: they would like fly off into the woods and retarded shit
(04:47:59 PM) jedireign: you get shit china steel but who givbes a shit
(04:48:04 PM) jedireign: it was $10
(04:48:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: I would buy like 10 at a time at the berlin auction
(04:48:15 PM) jedireign: I lost a $100 benchmade EDC and was _PISSED_
(04:48:25 PM) jedireign: for like 6 months
(04:48:30 PM) jedireign: I would just remember that I lost it like MOTHER FUCKER
(04:48:59 PM) jedireign: had it for a couple years, though, so I guess not all bad.
(04:49:04 PM) jedireign: I really want to get a nice fixed blade and a boot knife
(04:49:14 PM) jedireign: and maybe a karambit for the fun.
(04:49:29 PM) jedireign: I almost bought one of those the other day LOL but was like "ehhhhh $150 for a completely impractical knife ... nah"
(04:49:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: I just want a decent knife
(04:49:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: I should buy one
(04:49:58 PM) jedireign: benchmade man
(04:50:00 PM) jedireign: fucking legit.
(04:50:01 PM) Ryan Nealy: that flashlight was worth every penny I use it like every day
(04:50:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: and I have only charged it like 3 times since I've owned it
(04:50:23 PM) jedireign: lol nice
(04:50:33 PM) jedireign: I don't know why
(04:50:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: wish I had that one growing up honestly
(04:50:40 PM) jedireign: I just fucking love weaponry.

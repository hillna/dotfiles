(04:36:42 PM) jedireign: I feel guilty for having my perks
(04:36:43 PM) jedireign: it's hilarious
(04:36:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: heh
(04:36:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: my boss is awesome though he'll hook me up
(04:36:57 PM) jedireign: for using my perks* I guess you could say, because they don't exist elsewhere
(04:37:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: he loves paying employees he hates paying vendors
(04:37:01 PM) jedireign: G0W hosting!
(04:37:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah all that shit
(04:38:09 PM) jedireign: Mac Pro (Late 2013): 6 Displays: Can run six Apple Thunderbolt Displays using six Thunderbolt ports.[10] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display#cite_note-10)
(04:38:10 PM) jedireign: ahhhhhhh
(04:38:12 PM) jedireign: that would be
(04:38:14 PM) jedireign: ridiculously sick
(04:38:24 PM) jedireign: and $6k+ in displays.
(04:38:52 PM) jedireign: I am regretting not going 1440
(04:38:57 PM) jedireign: but I'm not regretting not paying twice as much
(04:39:07 PM) jedireign: lmfao
(04:39:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: hahahaha
(04:39:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah I mean
(04:39:23 PM) jedireign: gaming, 1080p is fine
(04:39:24 PM) jedireign: production?
(04:39:28 PM) jedireign: I WANT MORE REAL ESTATE FUCK
(04:39:35 PM) jedireign: if I 1/2 a browser on my monitor
(04:39:36 PM) jedireign: fucking
(04:39:45 PM) jedireign: 90% of websites switch into mobile cock gobbling mode
(04:39:51 PM) jedireign: because they're aqll
(04:40:04 PM) jedireign: OHHH LESS THAN 900 pixels wide? This must be a tablet or a phone!
(04:40:06 PM) jedireign: instead of like
(04:40:07 PM) jedireign: yoou know
(04:40:10 PM) jedireign: real mobile detection.
(04:45:50 PM) Ryan Nealy: wompety wompersons
(04:45:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: mcwompy
(04:46:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: ok so my earlier question
(04:46:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: I have 2 devices on one ethernet wire
(04:46:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: they go into 1 switch port
(04:46:30 PM) Ryan Nealy: they are on seperate vlans
(04:46:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: how does the switch interpret it. I know it strips the vlan tag off and somehow uses that to route it
(04:47:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: we are talking about an ip phone passthrough specificially
(04:47:27 PM) jedireign: ok let me think for a sec
(04:47:40 PM) jedireign: so not sure I get two devices on one wire?
(04:47:46 PM) jedireign: ip phone passthrough?
(04:47:50 PM) jedireign: I'm not sure I understand these things
(04:47:51 PM) jedireign: lol
(04:47:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: the ip phone essentially has a switch
(04:47:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: with 1 port
(04:47:57 PM) jedireign: ohhh
(04:48:00 PM) jedireign: interesting....
(04:48:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: so switch port
(04:48:04 PM) Ryan Nealy: goes to phone
(04:48:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: phone goes to computer
(04:48:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: very typical setup
(04:48:09 PM) jedireign: phone goes to computer
(04:48:10 PM) jedireign: Yeha
(04:48:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: also very typical to seperate then using vlan tagging
(04:48:19 PM) jedireign: you will need vlan tagging on computer/phone's interfaces to accomplish that
(04:48:21 PM) jedireign: can't use a port tag
(04:48:25 PM) Ryan Nealy: right
(04:48:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: so I leave pc's alone
(04:48:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: I use tftp on vlan 1....?
(04:48:43 PM) Ryan Nealy: to get them to vlan 2?
(04:48:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: can I do that?
(04:48:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: and then another tftp on vlan 2 to provision them
(04:48:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: lolol
(04:48:55 PM) jedireign: I'm not sure I'm following.
(04:49:02 PM) jedireign: You will tftp on the vlan the phone is on
(04:49:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: right
(04:49:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: but if they ship on vlan 1
(04:49:14 PM) jedireign: it won't commmunicate otherwise (unless routes exist)
(04:49:16 PM) Ryan Nealy: I would have to manually change them to vlan 2
(04:49:21 PM) jedireign: correct
(04:49:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: so here is what I" m thinking
(04:49:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: you plug in phone.
(04:49:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: it is on same vlan (1)
(04:49:35 PM) Ryan Nealy: it goes hey tftp
(04:49:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh thanks for that file yum yum
(04:49:44 PM) Ryan Nealy: reboot
(04:49:44 PM) jedireign: lol
(04:49:46 PM) Ryan Nealy: now I"m on vlan 2
(04:49:50 PM) jedireign: yep that should work
(04:49:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: hey tftp on vlan 2
(04:49:57 PM) Ryan Nealy: thanks for the dessert yum yum
(04:49:59 PM) jedireign: as long as the switch knoes that port is vlan 1 and vlan 2
(04:50:02 PM) Ryan Nealy: now I worky work
(04:50:08 PM) jedireign: why the first tftp on vlan 1?
(04:50:13 PM) jedireign: just to get it on vlan 2 for the config?
(04:50:21 PM) Ryan Nealy: you could technically do it in one step but
(04:50:27 PM) jedireign: yeah that's what I'm thinking
(04:50:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: if you were to say, change the extension nujmber on the phone
(04:50:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: it would not work
(04:50:33 PM) jedireign: OHHH
(04:50:34 PM) jedireign: I see
(04:50:37 PM) jedireign: ok that makes sense then
(04:50:42 PM) Ryan Nealy: the first one could literally
(04:50:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: just have 1 xml file
(04:50:46 PM) Ryan Nealy: that says
(04:50:46 PM) jedireign: and you don't want to manually configure the phone for vlan 2
(04:50:49 PM) Ryan Nealy: vlan_user_1 = 2
(04:50:51 PM) Ryan Nealy: and that's it
(04:51:00 PM) jedireign: yeah that makes sense
(04:51:04 PM) Ryan Nealy: ok but the problem I have
(04:51:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: what do you do on that port on the switch
(04:51:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: (all the ports will have this anyway
(04:51:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: )
(04:51:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: you make the ports "tagged" for vlans 1 and 2
(04:51:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: I guess?
(04:51:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: or just 2 I guess
(04:51:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: since 1 is usually default
(04:56:07 PM) jedireign: hm let me think there
(04:56:13 PM) jedireign: if you tag the port for vlan1&2
(04:56:19 PM) jedireign: it will be on both those vlans for every host
(04:56:32 PM) jedireign: I think you just enable tagging on that port and let the clients tags figure it out
(04:56:38 PM) jedireign: Not entirely sure  on your specific vendor, etc.
(04:56:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: and then what
(04:57:22 PM) jedireign: you'll need to enable tagging on everything, at tha tpoint
(04:57:25 PM) jedireign: sonicwall, etc
(04:57:35 PM) jedireign: I'm pretty sure
(05:02:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: I thought
(05:02:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: it would be like
(05:02:14 PM) Ryan Nealy: ok route all vlan tag 2
(05:02:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: to port x on the switch
(05:02:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: and that port on the switch is somehow mapped
(05:02:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah I have no idea LOL
(05:02:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: that's why I'm asking
(05:02:43 PM) jedireign: lmfao yeah
(05:02:44 PM) jedireign: so
(05:02:48 PM) jedireign: you're confusing vlans and routing
(05:02:58 PM) jedireign: vlans themselves don't do any routing
(05:02:59 PM) jedireign: so like
(05:03:02 PM) jedireign:  if something is on vlan 2
(05:03:06 PM) jedireign: it has no knowledge of or way to get to vlan 1
(05:03:57 PM) jedireign: this can be port vlans
(05:03:59 PM) jedireign: or vlan tag
(05:04:01 PM) jedireign: tags*
(05:05:43 PM) Ryan Nealy: yes I"m aware of that
(05:05:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: but the switch is aware of both
(05:05:50 PM) Ryan Nealy: so doesn't the switch say
(05:05:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: hey you vlan 2
(05:05:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: you go here
(05:06:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: no?
(05:06:43 PM) jedireign: in a way, yes
(05:06:44 PM) jedireign: liuke
(05:06:49 PM) jedireign: it will say "go to any vlan 2 port"
(05:06:52 PM) jedireign: or tag
(05:06:58 PM) jedireign: but between vlans
(05:07:00 PM) jedireign: it cannot do
(05:07:05 PM) jedireign: (unless something is tagged for both)
(05:07:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: right oh yeah I'm not trying to do that
(05:07:11 PM) jedireign: oh right ok
(05:07:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: so then
(05:07:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: I just have 2 physical ports maybe from sonic
(05:07:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: one tagged for vlan 1
(05:07:26 PM) jedireign: so you'll have the port set to 1,2 and the phone tagged to vlan 2
(05:07:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: one tagged for vlan2
(05:07:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: I could do that right
(05:07:31 PM) jedireign: then have the phone system on a port for vlan2
(05:07:35 PM) jedireign: oh
(05:07:36 PM) jedireign: yeah
(05:07:38 PM) jedireign: that's the easiest way
(05:07:43 PM) jedireign: then match them to ports on the switch
(05:07:53 PM) jedireign: you _could_ trunk vlans ove ra single 
(05:07:55 PM) jedireign: but why
(05:07:55 PM) jedireign: lol
(05:08:01 PM) jedireign: it's so much more complicated tht way
(05:08:25 PM) Ryan Nealy: I dunno
(05:08:58 PM) jedireign: because you then need to split that all logically with routing and firewall rules and shit
(05:09:03 PM) jedireign: instead of just saying "this port on this vlan"
(05:10:01 PM) Ryan Nealy: right
(05:10:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: aka
(05:10:10 PM) Ryan Nealy: sub interfaces
(05:10:16 PM) Ryan Nealy: as sonicwall calls them I believe
(05:10:33 PM) Ryan Nealy: so if you were to do say
(05:10:35 PM) Ryan Nealy: 10vlan tags
(05:10:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: wouldn't the switch just overload itself
(05:10:42 PM) Ryan Nealy: and explode
(05:10:47 PM) jedireign: lmfao not at all
(05:10:50 PM) jedireign: vlans are simple for it to compute
(05:10:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's now switching 10 networks
(05:10:56 PM) Ryan Nealy: instead of one
(05:10:58 PM) jedireign: it can handle thousands
(05:11:05 PM) jedireign: as far as the hardware is concerned it's no more extra work
(05:11:06 PM) jedireign: well a bit
(05:11:07 PM) jedireign: but not much
(05:11:11 PM) jedireign: it's doing just as much switching.
(05:11:35 PM) jedireign: only two separate spanning trees, instead of one big one
(05:12:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh
(05:12:05 PM) Ryan Nealy: so on sonicwall
(05:12:07 PM) Ryan Nealy: I can just say
(05:12:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: what vlan tag it is
(05:12:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: that seems really easy
(05:12:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'll wait till everyone leaves before I do that lol
(05:12:36 PM) Ryan Nealy: I have to stay late to unhook everything and hook up the new PDU and battery backup anyway
(05:12:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: got some chicken on the way
(05:12:44 PM) jedireign: sweet
(05:13:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: my dad finally hooking up his raspberry pi
(05:13:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: after all this time
(05:14:19 PM) jedireign: lmao
(05:14:20 PM) jedireign: awesome
(05:14:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: the sad thing is I never even finished it
(05:14:28 PM) jedireign: now that summer is coming and the behemoth is off
(05:14:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah exactly
(05:14:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: LOL
(05:14:35 PM) Ryan Nealy: also that
(05:14:36 PM) jedireign: hey
(05:14:37 PM) jedireign: though
(05:14:39 PM) jedireign: it's better than like
(05:14:43 PM) jedireign: or wait
(05:14:44 PM) jedireign: nevermind
(05:14:48 PM) jedireign: it's not controlling anything only monitoring
(05:14:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: I mean it reads temperatures
(05:14:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: to a text file
(05:14:57 PM) jedireign: yeah.
(05:14:58 PM) jedireign: lmfao
(05:15:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: but it needs to get out to http
(05:15:10 PM) Ryan Nealy: just like
(05:15:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: tail -f
(05:15:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: leave it running forever
(05:15:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: the most rigged thing on earth
(05:24:34 PM) jedireign: lmxo
(05:39:42 PM) jedireign: My single 980 will not push Ultra at 1440 and 144Hz on my Swift.
(05:39:43 PM) jedireign: ""
(05:39:46 PM) jedireign: LOL jesus
(05:39:54 PM) jedireign: 1440p144hz is no joke for gaming.
(05:47:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: heh

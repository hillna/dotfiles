(12:12:14 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm going to try spiceworks
(12:34:15 PM) jedireign: Hey, I have exactly the same issue. I launch the launcher and after a bit of loading it just closes without saying, that the program crashed or anything. I found a solution for me. Well... Not a solution as such but a workaround. I have to delete the social club folder every time I want to start the game. When I delete it, I simply start the launcher, it downloads 53.79 MB (the size of social club), installs it and the game launches perfectly. It still kinda pisses mě off, that I have to wait about two minutes for the game to start but at least it works. I hope this will help you.
(12:34:16 PM) jedireign: LOL
(12:34:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: I tried that already pretty sure
(12:34:44 PM) jedireign: hm

(12:34:57 PM) jedireign: I don't remember fully
(12:35:00 PM) jedireign: such as tupid problem
(12:35:18 PM) jedireign: "No, it mysteriously solved itself.
Just clicked the shortcut one day and it worked."
(12:35:19 PM) jedireign: hahaha
(12:35:21 PM) jedireign: god damn ti computers
(12:36:48 PM) jedireign: You did the disable video card thing, then launch, yeah?
(12:37:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah
(12:37:20 PM) jedireign: uuugh
(12:37:25 PM) jedireign: I think I'm literally more upset about this than you are
(12:37:26 PM) jedireign: LOL
(12:37:37 PM) jedireign: like the whole time Joe and I were playing like "omfg what if ryan was here OMFG"
(12:37:45 PM) jedireign: we stole a chopper and I was giong to have him snipe player sfrom the door
(12:37:50 PM) jedireign:  (until we crashed)
(12:38:31 PM) jedireign: joe said something about issues with the Trials launcher?
(12:38:41 PM) jedireign: Yo is your home dir and %appdata% and shit a network share!?
(12:39:13 PM) jedireign: and if so is there AV and shit on that sidE?
(12:39:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: yes
(12:39:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: and no
(12:39:17 PM) jedireign: yoooo I think I'm on to something.
(12:39:26 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah it's prob that I"m sure
(12:39:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: soo
(12:39:32 PM) jedireign: is there an easy way to like
(12:39:34 PM) jedireign: temp disable it to play?
(12:39:35 PM) Ryan Nealy: no
(12:39:42 PM) Ryan Nealy: soo here's the thing
(12:39:44 PM) jedireign: or to jsut have the game use local storagbe?
(12:39:45 PM) jedireign: hmmm
(12:39:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: I tested that first to get out of the way
(12:39:58 PM) jedireign: oh how so?
(12:40:02 PM) Ryan Nealy: 1. only documents, desktop, pictures, etc are redirected to \\server-uncpath
(12:40:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: appdata, both roaming and locak, are still local
(12:40:16 PM) jedireign: oh ok so it's redirected, not /users/ryan is a mounted SMB share
(12:40:29 PM) jedireign: ahaha
(12:40:35 PM) jedireign: look at me unix pathing windows like a fag
(12:41:13 PM) jedireign: joe mentions trials fusion - did you ever get that working?
(12:41:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's folder redirection via gpo
(12:41:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: but not roaming profiles
(12:41:56 PM) Ryan Nealy: it has caused problems in 2 games but there is a pretty easy way to test it
(12:41:56 PM) jedireign: right right
(12:42:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: 1. trials fusion would store it's config file in my documents, obviously the problem
(12:42:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: but it couldn't read it via UNC path
(12:42:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: so it would break
(12:42:18 PM) jedireign: aha
(12:42:19 PM) jedireign: gotcha
(12:42:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: they patched it pretty quickly
(12:42:30 PM) Ryan Nealy: after I told them what was wrong LOl in a forum post
(12:42:32 PM) jedireign: hmmm I wonder if something similar is going on here wit h some fucking weird dir or some bullshit?
(12:42:34 PM) jedireign: hahaha
(12:42:37 PM) jedireign: Nice!
(12:42:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: alright so next
(12:42:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: dayz did the same thing
(12:42:46 PM) jedireign: oh yeah I remember that
(12:42:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: but instead of not working it would just not save any settings
(12:42:58 PM) Ryan Nealy: so I used a launch parameter in the game to redirect it to a local folder
(12:42:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: easy fix
(12:43:07 PM) Ryan Nealy: but most games work fine with it
(12:43:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: and you can tell my checking the date modified/created on the folder
(12:43:25 PM) jedireign: yeah
(12:43:26 PM) Ryan Nealy: if it's actively reading/modifying the folder it usually works
(12:43:30 PM) jedireign: so sounds like you've got that base covered lol
(12:43:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: is my reasoning
(12:43:36 PM) Ryan Nealy: but it could still be the problem
(12:43:43 PM) Ryan Nealy: but I'm not going to turn it off either heh
(12:43:47 PM) jedireign: hmmmm
(12:43:48 PM) jedireign: oh yeah
(12:43:49 PM) jedireign: not saying that
(12:43:53 PM) jedireign: trying to figure out workaround if that's the issue
(12:43:54 PM) jedireign: not saying
(12:43:58 PM) Ryan Nealy: I was trying to find some way to tell it where to store that folder
(12:44:02 PM) Ryan Nealy: but couldn't find it
(12:44:03 PM) jedireign: OMFFG RYAN REDO YOUR WHOLE HOME NETWORK FOR A GAME STOP BEING A LOOOSER
(12:45:35 PM) jedireign: Launching it creates a file named "Local剜捯獫慴⁲慇敭屳呇⁁屖湥楴汴" in my users\username\AppData folder.Anyone know what that is all about ?
(12:45:36 PM) jedireign: yooo
(12:45:38 PM) jedireign: hahahahaha
(12:45:40 PM) jedireign: this guy
(12:45:44 PM) jedireign: is having some serious issues
(12:46:05 PM) jedireign: "Nope, but AFAIK if you're having this issue then try running the game from a separate local Admin account. I have this problem too. It seems to me that whatever that issue is related to people having weird characters in their usernames is affecting us too. As we speak I'm trying to switch my main account to a local account to see if this helps. EDIT: This worked. I can run the game fine now."
(12:46:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: some people saying to fix it with symlinks
(12:46:09 PM) jedireign: hmm
(12:46:14 PM) jedireign: yo can you symlink in windows?
(12:46:15 PM) jedireign: wtf?
(12:46:16 PM) jedireign: since when?
(12:46:19 PM) jedireign: LOL
(12:46:33 PM) jedireign: but uhh yeah seeing a lot of stuff like "Make a new admin user and it works!"
(12:46:35 PM) jedireign: all over the place
(12:46:39 PM) jedireign: not sure if you tried a secondary user or not
(12:46:42 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah but that's only for special characters
(12:46:43 PM) Ryan Nealy: however
(12:46:44 PM) Ryan Nealy: however
(12:46:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: however
(12:46:47 PM) jedireign: HOWEVERRR
(12:46:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: my username is technically
(12:46:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: kcs\Ryan
(12:46:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: I don't know if it would treat it that way
(12:47:11 PM) jedireign: YES
(12:47:17 PM) jedireign: that's probably the problem
(12:47:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: ugh
(12:47:24 PM) jedireign: especially with \
(12:47:25 PM) jedireign: being a path
(12:47:26 PM) Ryan Nealy: fucking game
(12:47:26 PM) jedireign: thing
(12:47:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's not
(12:47:29 PM) jedireign: so it's trying to write to like
(12:47:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's just a domain user account
(12:47:33 PM) jedireign: right
(12:47:37 PM) jedireign: but if the game is seing that
(12:47:44 PM) jedireign: and trying to write to C:/users/kcs\ryan/blah
(12:47:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm not sure if it is I guess
(12:47:52 PM) jedireign: like an idiot
(12:47:53 PM) jedireign: yeah hm
(12:47:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: I can try a local account
(12:47:57 PM) jedireign: try making a local non-domain account
(12:47:59 PM) jedireign: I bet it will work
(12:47:59 PM) jedireign:  :D
(12:48:01 PM) Ryan Nealy: just for fucking this shit ass fuck tard game

(12:54:05 PM) Ryan Nealy: I started gta 4 and just lost interest prety quick
(12:54:05 PM) jedireign: GTA IV was when they were like
(12:54:08 PM) jedireign: "Oh shit stories matter."
(12:54:13 PM) jedireign: but still was clunky about it
(12:54:17 PM) jedireign: I never beat IV not very interesting
(12:54:19 PM) jedireign: this is like
(12:54:28 PM) jedireign: the perfection culmination of everything rockstar has done to date
(12:54:32 PM) jedireign: like it was all practice
(12:54:37 PM) jedireign: hahaha I couldn't put the game down when it was on 360
(12:54:42 PM) jedireign: and now that I have PC MULTIPLAYER

(12:57:58 PM) jedireign: that isn't garbage?
(12:58:08 PM) jedireign: I'm about to make a fucking company to do that because they're all garbage.
(01:05:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: there isn't one
(01:05:18 PM) jedireign: exactly
(01:05:19 PM) jedireign: LOL
(01:05:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: I reserached it the only ones that support decent particpantl evels is like
(01:05:36 PM) jedireign: it's our biggest problem as a remote team, and we're definitely not the only ones who need it.
(01:05:37 PM) Ryan Nealy: microsoft lync
(01:05:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: and the adobe one
(01:05:41 PM) jedireign: yeah no
(01:05:43 PM) jedireign: not happening
(01:05:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: literally lync just
(01:05:49 PM) jedireign: has to support every platofrm, as well
(01:05:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: wreks the competition
(01:05:56 PM) Ryan Nealy: it has a web add in
(01:05:58 PM) jedireign: we use Fuze right now.
(01:06:02 PM) Ryan Nealy: but I don't know if it works on linux it does work on mac
(01:06:05 PM) jedireign: does it work chrome limnux blah?
(01:06:06 PM) jedireign: yeah ok
(01:06:07 PM) jedireign: hmmm
(01:06:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's really expensive
(01:06:19 PM) jedireign: yeah that's anotehr issue
(01:06:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: but not like pro video level expensive
(01:06:37 PM) Ryan Nealy: it would be about 10k for and a ton of bandwidth or w/e
(01:06:43 PM) jedireign: there are a billion live cam porn sites
(01:06:53 PM) jedireign: I be tI oculd repurpose that software and get an amazing video conferencing site
(01:06:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: one way is different then 2 way
(01:06:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: multi party
(01:07:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: multi party video is like
(01:07:01 PM) jedireign: it would just be
(01:07:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: so hard to achieve
(01:07:05 PM) jedireign: multiple oine way video sterams
(01:08:01 PM) jedireign: it's a totally solvable problem
(01:08:03 PM) jedireign: just no one has done so.
(01:08:04 PM) jedireign: lol
(01:08:23 PM) jedireign: it doesn't need to be incredible low latency real time high quality or anything, either
(01:08:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: lync is really the only one that supprts unlimited multi party video
(01:08:57 PM) Ryan Nealy: we do
(01:08:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: 10 person calls
(01:09:02 PM) jedireign: I'll look into it
(01:09:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: the so called "brady bunch" view
(01:09:07 PM) jedireign: yeah we do like 30-40 peole right now
(01:09:09 PM) jedireign: but are growing
(01:09:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: quit hard to achieve
(01:09:12 PM) jedireign: LOL YEP fuze does that
(01:09:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: you could do 100 participants supposedly
(01:09:25 PM) Ryan Nealy: hahahahaha
(01:09:25 PM) jedireign: but there's no fuze on linux is the problem
(01:09:28 PM) jedireign: yeah
(01:09:45 PM) jedireign: probably 1/4-1/3 of the company is all linux
(01:13:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: I've come to realize
(01:13:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's just too demanding
(01:13:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: even for client side
(01:13:23 PM) jedireign: it's essential for us
(01:13:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: try running fucking 30 video streams
(01:13:29 PM) jedireign: considering half our company is out of the country LOL
(01:13:33 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm not saying that
(01:13:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm just saying the technology is not there heh
(01:13:42 PM) Ryan Nealy: unless you go like
(01:13:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: crazy proprietary
(01:13:46 PM) jedireign: it is though
(01:13:54 PM) jedireign: I hvae 20+ video streams right now with no issue.
(01:14:04 PM) jedireign: beautiful HD stremas
(01:14:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: must use some crazy shit on server side
(01:14:19 PM) Ryan Nealy: think about how much processing is required for 20 1080p streams
(01:14:33 PM) jedireign: yeah but it's not like it's 3d video
(01:14:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's hardcore downscaled
(01:14:43 PM) jedireign: and generating it on the fly
(01:14:44 PM) Ryan Nealy: you should see
(01:14:44 PM) jedireign: but anyway
(01:14:52 PM) jedireign: gotta get back to this meeting.
(01:14:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: google "lync bandiwdth calculator"
(01:14:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: and you'll be like
(01:14:57 PM) Ryan Nealy: WTF
(01:15:01 PM) jedireign: lol yeah
(01:15:03 PM) jedireign: not sure how fuze does it
(01:15:09 PM) jedireign: but it barely affectins my internet
(01:15:10 PM) Ryan Nealy: no not the sum or outcome
(01:15:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: the complexity of the damn spreadsheet
(01:15:21 PM) jedireign: I think it compiles them all and is coming in a single stream?
(01:15:23 PM) jedireign: No idea.
(01:15:32 PM) jedireign: butit works
(01:15:37 PM) jedireign: just no linux version. LOL
(01:15:40 PM) jedireign: not web based either.
(01:15:44 PM) jedireign: and no screen share.
(01:15:46 PM) jedireign: we use gotomeeting for that
(01:16:04 PM) jedireign: they had a linux version
(01:16:06 PM) jedireign: it was garbage
(01:16:08 PM) jedireign: they gave up on it
(02:11:35 PM) jedireign: baaaaack
(02:11:38 PM) jedireign: long ass meeting jesus
(03:00:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: ur bad

(03:00:55 PM) jedireign: lol
(03:00:58 PM) jedireign: nah it's morel ike
(03:01:16 PM) jedireign: My windows is fucking retarded and can't handle its own remote user file storage schennanegans 
(03:02:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: haha
(03:02:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's honestly only a problem wit hgames
(03:02:32 PM) jedireign: lol such a stupid problem
(03:02:33 PM) Ryan Nealy: and I"m not even using roaming appdata folder
(03:02:34 PM) jedireign: yeah
(03:02:36 PM) jedireign: but like
(03:02:37 PM) Ryan Nealy: that is where the problem usually resides
(03:02:39 PM) jedireign: WHY
(03:02:39 PM) jedireign: lol
(03:02:44 PM) jedireign: it's such a stupid problem
(03:02:49 PM) Ryan Nealy: games can't read unc paths
(03:02:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: is what it usually comes down to
(03:02:54 PM) jedireign: if directory is available it should just work
(03:02:54 PM) jedireign: like
(03:02:58 PM) jedireign: WUT why not though
(03:02:58 PM) jedireign: haha
(03:02:59 PM) jedireign: that's the thing
(03:03:06 PM) jedireign: that should just be intrinsically handled by the OS/filesystem
(03:03:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: well
(03:03:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: idk I honestly don't think that's the problem this time
(03:03:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: but I'm still gonna try it
(03:03:24 PM) jedireign: should be completely abstracted and invisible to any guest application
(03:03:25 PM) jedireign: but yeah
(03:03:31 PM) jedireign: yeah local non domain user blah blah blah
(03:03:35 PM) jedireign: fucking stupid
(03:03:37 PM) jedireign: but hopefully it works
(03:03:48 PM) jedireign: any response from steam?
(03:03:53 PM) jedireign: or rockstar?
(03:04:00 PM) jedireign: watch rockstar be like
(03:04:02 PM) jedireign: "Just do dis"
(03:04:03 PM) jedireign: and it works
(03:04:10 PM) jedireign: and the answer is just burried under a thousand bitches whining in forums
(03:05:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: no response yet on either
(03:05:37 PM) jedireign: word

(03:11:19 PM) Ryan Nealy: literally the stupidest yet simplest thing I have seen
(03:11:21 PM) Ryan Nealy: and it's so useful
(03:11:38 PM) jedireign: nice
(03:11:50 PM) Ryan Nealy: I just emailed you a screenshot
(03:11:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's like a graph of used IP"s
(03:12:35 PM) jedireign: oh that's pretty cool
(03:12:37 PM) jedireign: super confusing layout
(03:12:37 PM) jedireign: lol

(04:09:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah my ups have fans
(04:09:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: so I suppose that makes sense
(04:09:07 PM) jedireign: better airflow to the fans
(04:09:08 PM) jedireign: yeah
(04:09:11 PM) jedireign: unless vented is like
(04:09:13 PM) jedireign: way more expensive
(04:09:15 PM) jedireign: no reason why not

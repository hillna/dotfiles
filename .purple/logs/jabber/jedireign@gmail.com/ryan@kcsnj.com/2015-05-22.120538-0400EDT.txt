(02:38:38 PM) Ryan Nealy: was thinking about trying to tint my own windows on the truck
(02:38:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: it'll prob turn out bad but I already had some tint left over from a project
(02:39:41 PM) jedireign: hehe
(02:39:47 PM) jedireign: your side markers?
(02:39:49 PM) jedireign: those looked great.
(02:39:55 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah that turned out so well right?
(02:40:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: they still look perfect
(02:40:07 PM) Ryan Nealy: tint cost like 5 dollars
(02:40:11 PM) jedireign: yeah
(02:40:14 PM) jedireign: it's expensive to getg done
(02:40:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: the smoked lights were like 25 bucks each so I made out good on that light
(02:40:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah it's cause for like taillights
(02:40:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: they are premade to fit the light
(02:40:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: mfg specific
(02:40:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: 100 bucsk to get my tail lights done I said fuck that although still kind of want it
(02:41:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: I honestly want new tail lights but I'm so damn picky I'll never find any that I like
(02:44:22 PM) jedireign: there are some nice ass LED headlights for the jeep
(02:44:25 PM) jedireign: but they're like $300
(02:44:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: I think I"m going to get a cover for my vw
(02:44:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: and start parking in the back and driving the truck to work
(02:44:58 PM) Ryan Nealy: so I can have the car paid off and be like
(02:45:01 PM) Ryan Nealy: damn pristine
(02:45:46 PM) Ryan Nealy: do you know anything about covers
(02:45:49 PM) Ryan Nealy: http://www.carautocovers.com/2009/volkswagen/jetta/volkswagen-jetta-2009-sedan-4-door-car-cover.html
(02:45:56 PM) jedireign: not really
(02:46:20 PM) jedireign: but it's probably a matter of get a decent one
(02:46:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: 145 bucks I guess not really that bad
(02:46:24 PM) jedireign: I always see cars under these like
(02:46:29 PM) jedireign: DIRTY ASS GRODY COVERS
(02:46:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: I just don't want it to damage the pain
(02:46:35 PM) jedireign: and just htink that the paint must be getting RUINED
(02:46:36 PM) Ryan Nealy: *paint
(02:46:37 PM) jedireign: yeah
(02:46:49 PM) Ryan Nealy: it just seems dumb to pay for a cover for a 98 tacoma haha
(02:46:51 PM) jedireign: like oh no some sand under the covber
(02:46:53 PM) jedireign: _ruined_
(02:47:07 PM) Ryan Nealy: not to mention it's a pickup so like the bed will just pool with water no matter what cover I get most likely
(02:48:36 PM) jedireign: http://www.collegehumor.com/post/7021815/chris-pratt-got-drunk-and-tried-to-give-acting-tips
(02:56:38 PM) jedireign: jeeze winches are nuts
(02:56:43 PM) jedireign: they go from like 400-1200
(02:57:02 PM) Ryan Nealy: so if ur truck weighst say 2k pounds right
(02:57:02 PM) jedireign: there are some for 300 or so
(02:57:05 PM) jedireign: but they're probably garbage
(02:57:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: and you're in the mud
(02:57:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: you could be pulling way more then that yes?
(02:57:17 PM) jedireign: yeah definitely
(02:57:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: resistence or whatever
(02:57:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: so I wonder what the formula for that is
(02:57:25 PM) jedireign: I think the recommendation is like 8k winch for the jeep
(02:57:51 PM) jedireign: curb weight is 3241lbs
(02:58:05 PM) Ryan Nealy: that's like 2.5 ish
(02:58:12 PM) jedireign: 2.5?
(02:58:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: always wondered that
(02:58:19 PM) Ryan Nealy: the ratio or what not
(02:58:22 PM) jedireign: oh
(02:58:33 PM) jedireign: wait no
(02:58:37 PM) jedireign: was looking at wrong jeep -B
(02:58:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: 2.5x the weight of the vehicle
(02:58:45 PM) jedireign: it's 3760-4340 for the JKU
(02:58:50 PM) jedireign: JK* depending on options
(02:58:55 PM) jedireign: so probably closer to the 4300 mark on mine
(03:00:43 PM) jedireign: "Safety rule of thumb for winch capability is rig weight x 2. A stock JKU weighs on average around 4,500 lbs, so a 9,000 lb winch will get you in the range."
(03:01:46 PM) jedireign: quadratec recommends "We recommend selecting a winch that's at least 50% greater than your Gross Vehicle Weight. That's 1.5 times the GVW."
(03:02:51 PM) Ryan Nealy: interesting
(03:02:56 PM) Ryan Nealy: those are pretty big differences though heh
(03:03:08 PM) jedireign: yeah one was some asshole on a forum
(03:03:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: after reading that
(03:03:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's like 2.5
(03:03:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: just in case
(03:03:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: haha
(03:03:26 PM) Ryan Nealy: I guess it's like
(03:03:28 PM) jedireign: another was a website with a winch choosing thing from a site tghat sells only jeep shitg
(03:03:29 PM) jedireign: http://www.quadratec.com/products/11116_6002_07.htm 
(03:03:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: how much resistance could mud really be
(03:03:34 PM) jedireign: is fucking _sick_
(03:03:41 PM) jedireign: Well you might be pull up hill.
(03:03:47 PM) jedireign: you mightg be recovering an F250
(03:03:48 PM) jedireign: etc
(03:03:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah but the model is not relevant only weight
(03:04:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: but like
(03:04:07 PM) jedireign: right my point being an F250 is a lot heavbeir than I am.
(03:04:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: if it is 5k pound vehicle
(03:04:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: and i'ts literally hanging on the winch
(03:04:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's 5k pounds on the winch
(03:04:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: so the only thing that would make it more would be a really crazy angle where you were pulling INTO the ground aka a steep ass hill
(03:04:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: and your tow vehicle was on level ground at the top
(03:04:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: or the old mud vacuum type deal
(03:05:25 PM) jedireign: when my softtop goes to shit I'm definitgely getting one of tghose
(03:05:36 PM) jedireign: still half the price of a hard top lol
(03:07:10 PM) jedireign: and this http://www.quadratec.com/vendor/Quadratec+Exclusive/Jeep+Tools/index.htm

(03:07:21 PM) jedireign: http://www.quadratec.com/products/92043_1200.htm
(03:07:26 PM) jedireign: air tools on the trail.
(03:10:39 PM) jedireign: http://www.jcroffroad.com/product/JKBmp/JKFF.html
(03:11:13 PM) jedireign: http://www.jcroffroad.com/product/JKBmp/JKFD-T.html
(03:11:36 PM) jedireign: the problem though with jeep having 70 years of aftermarket is finding the parts that aren't garbage
(03:13:54 PM) jedireign: if only I could weld.
(03:14:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: haha
(03:14:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: even if you could
(03:14:12 PM) jedireign: lol yeah
(03:14:14 PM) Ryan Nealy: it would prob not be cost effective to do that shit
(03:16:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: I feel like automatic tire inflation is just like
(03:16:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: the most luxurious feature ever
(03:16:29 PM) jedireign: not automatic, but having an on board compressor
(03:16:39 PM) jedireign: at least that's waht's linked above
(03:16:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh you still have to get out and do it?
(03:16:42 PM) jedireign: you still need air hose and stuff
(03:16:43 PM) jedireign: yeah
(03:17:09 PM) jedireign: the coupling for an automatic version would probably be the least reliable thing ever on a non military vehicle
(03:17:10 PM) jedireign: lol
(03:17:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: hahaha
(03:17:19 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah I was thinking that
(03:17:19 PM) jedireign: Though I do think HMMVs have it
(03:17:26 PM) Ryan Nealy: no idea how that works
(03:17:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: some helicopter style parts quality
(03:17:37 PM) jedireign: yeah it would have to go through the wheel hub
(03:17:41 PM) jedireign: and it would be ridiculous
(03:17:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: you know what though
(03:18:01 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's prob like
(03:18:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: only a seal required when inflating
(03:18:18 PM) jedireign: yeah that's probably true
(03:18:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: and when not inflating it just has some sort of spring or something
(03:18:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: which makes it not quite as ridiculous
(03:18:33 PM) Ryan Nealy: not like full time airtite rotating seal @ 60 mph
(03:18:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: hahahaha
(03:18:35 PM) Ryan Nealy: impossible
(03:18:43 PM) jedireign: http://www.roadranger.com/Roadranger/productssolutions/tiremanagement/centraltireinflationsystem(ctis)/index.htm

(03:19:41 PM) jedireign: hahahaha
(03:19:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: yes it is
(03:19:47 PM) jedireign: hose comes from your bumper to the little rotator hub
(03:19:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: ultra ghetto
(03:19:50 PM) jedireign: then hose goes to your valve stem
(03:19:52 PM) jedireign: LOL
(03:20:02 PM) jedireign: yeah that's not going to get torn off immediately.
(03:20:02 PM) jedireign: no

(03:23:10 PM) Ryan Nealy: right!
(03:23:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: you have to skip way ahead to like 8 minutes to see him use it though
(03:23:20 PM) jedireign: haha

(03:23:29 PM) jedireign: lol

(03:24:30 PM) jedireign: I just want to go camping in places you can'T reach by a car.
(03:24:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm not really into mud like that
(03:24:42 PM) Ryan Nealy: but 
(03:24:49 PM) Ryan Nealy: getting through is pretty god damn satisfying
(03:24:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's different in nj though
(03:25:04 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's like that brown dirt mud
(03:25:10 PM) Ryan Nealy: and sometimes the puddle is like 2 inches deep
(03:25:11 PM) jedireign: yeah
(03:25:12 PM) jedireign: lol

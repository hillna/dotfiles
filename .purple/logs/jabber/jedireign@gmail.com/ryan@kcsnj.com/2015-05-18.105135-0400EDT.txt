(12:05:51 PM) Ryan Nealy: uhhh
(12:05:56 PM) jedireign: Something I've wanted to do for like 15 years
(12:06:07 PM) jedireign: bought a jump at an airport near my hous in Philly
(12:06:09 PM) jedireign: and fucking
(12:06:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm not sure why it just doesn't sound all that great to me
(12:06:14 PM) jedireign: every time I went to jump\ weather would fuck me
(12:06:21 PM) jedireign: it sounds like the most amazing thing to me
(12:06:22 PM) jedireign: also
(12:06:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: like I mean it sounds fun
(12:06:24 PM) jedireign: wingsuiting
(12:06:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: heh
(12:06:29 PM) jedireign: what could be a greater experience than wing suiotingn
(12:06:40 PM) Ryan Nealy: I guess it's hard for me to imagine how it would really feel
(12:06:40 PM) jedireign: but that's like 300+ jumps in Lol
(12:06:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: like your so high up I feel like it wouldn't feel like you were really moving
(12:07:05 PM) jedireign: the drop zone for me by does accelerated free fall for first jump
(12:07:09 PM) jedireign: which I miiiight do
(12:07:09 PM) jedireign: which is
(12:07:15 PM) jedireign: you jump solo but with instructors with you
(12:07:21 PM) jedireign: pull and fly your own chute
(12:07:21 PM) jedireign: etc
(12:07:28 PM) jedireign: it's the first step of certification
(12:07:33 PM) jedireign: but most people tandem jump first
(12:07:36 PM) Ryan Nealy: flying your own chute sounds hard as a first try
(12:07:41 PM) jedireign: yeah, butg thing is
(12:07:50 PM) jedireign: you either fly your own chute or tandem
(12:07:52 PM) jedireign: tandem is a ride.
(12:08:03 PM) jedireign: you literally don't do shit
(12:08:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah 
(12:08:16 PM) Ryan Nealy: but if you land too hard you break ur leg and then it sux
(12:08:28 PM) jedireign: yeah but you'll be in the same position on a first jump toward certification anyway
(12:08:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: the whole parachute not opening thing isn't really the scary part to me although I guess it still is
(12:08:36 PM) jedireign: so why pay the same for a tandem jump you don't get in your log book
(12:08:44 PM) Ryan Nealy: that's true
(12:08:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: but you could also say
(12:08:58 PM) Ryan Nealy: why buy 2 motorcycles it's a waste of money
(12:09:04 PM) jedireign: lmao what?
(12:09:05 PM) Ryan Nealy: cause it's safer to learn on a small one :)
(12:09:07 PM) jedireign: how does that compare?
(12:09:07 PM) jedireign: oh
(12:09:11 PM) jedireign: yeah but you do'nt lear ni ntandem
(12:09:12 PM) jedireign: that's my point
(12:09:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: like way safer
(12:09:15 PM) jedireign: that's like
(12:09:21 PM) jedireign: Sitting in the side car of someone else's bike
(12:09:25 PM) Ryan Nealy: you could learn that you can confidently not freak out
(12:09:30 PM) Ryan Nealy: lol
(12:09:30 PM) jedireign: lmfao yeah there's that
(12:09:39 PM) jedireign: I've done ziplines and shit
(12:09:42 PM) jedireign: heights don't bother me
(12:09:44 PM) jedireign: etc
(12:09:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: bro I rode in a side car once
(12:09:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: that shit was awesome
(12:09:49 PM) jedireign: hahahahhah
(12:09:53 PM) jedireign: oh yeah I'm sure tandem is incredible
(12:09:56 PM) jedireign: but if I want to jump more than once
(12:09:59 PM) jedireign: it's kind of a waste
(12:10:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: I suppose
(12:10:43 PM) jedireign: also if you do freak out there's the AAD amd the two dudes jumping right next to you
(12:11:48 PM) jedireign: ahh but either way though
(12:11:52 PM) jedireign: I'll probably end up tandeming first
(12:11:59 PM) jedireign: to make sure I don't freak the fuck out and it's actually something I enjoy
(12:12:02 PM) jedireign: but wing suiting man
(12:12:05 PM) jedireign: I can't imagine a greater thing

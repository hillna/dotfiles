(03:44:29 PM) jedireign: basically a delayed shutdown circuit for raspi
(03:44:35 PM) jedireign: when it loses power, it sends a shutdown signal to raspi
(03:44:37 PM) jedireign: like a UPS does
(03:44:44 PM) jedireign: and then shuts off its USB ports after so many seconds
(03:44:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: sweet
(03:45:04 PM) jedireign: my current plan was just

(03:56:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: LOLz :)
(03:57:03 PM) jedireign: lmfao
(03:57:10 PM) jedireign: "you're so bad you have to win 10 more times"
(03:57:18 PM) Ryan Nealy: hahahahahahahaah
(03:57:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: I was talking to Slavic about ranks
(03:57:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: he said basically you can rank up pretty far just by playing
(03:57:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: and I"m starting to realize he is right cause there are a lot of people who just play tons of comp and get high ranks
(03:57:53 PM) jedireign: yeah
(03:58:03 PM) Ryan Nealy: maybe i put too much faith in it being skill based
(03:58:06 PM) jedireign: but not only that you literally get better by playing.
(03:58:15 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah but like I know these 2 guys
(03:58:19 PM) Ryan Nealy: and I'm def better then them
(03:58:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: they are both gold nova 4 or w/e
(03:58:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: they aren't really that good
(03:58:28 PM) jedireign: yeah they probably have a lot more matches than you
(03:58:32 PM) jedireign: spreading out that curve
(03:58:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: yeah like 100
(03:58:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: I have like 30
(03:58:44 PM) jedireign: yeah so like
(03:58:49 PM) jedireign: think of it this way
(03:58:51 PM) jedireign: if you got like
(03:58:54 PM) jedireign: 4:1 in 30 games
(03:59:01 PM) jedireign: and tehy got 3:2 in 100 games
(03:59:06 PM) jedireign: they're "statistically" better
(03:59:15 PM) jedireign: but that doesn't mean shit
(03:59:19 PM) jedireign: because of the spread in games played
(03:59:55 PM) jedireign: you can hit 8 home runs in you first game, and the leading home runner could hit 3
(03:59:58 PM) jedireign: but if he's hit 3 for 100 games
(04:00:00 PM) jedireign: and you're on your first
(04:00:01 PM) jedireign: etc.
(04:00:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah
(04:00:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm gonna start challenging everyoen to 1v 1
(04:00:23 PM) jedireign: so yes it is skill based, but statistics wins.
(04:00:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: for shit talking purposes
(04:00:35 PM) jedireign: and squad kills don't apply in 1v1
(04:00:42 PM) jedireign: you'll obviously win in 1v1 with your go hard and delayedgo hard
(04:00:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: LOL
(04:00:52 PM) Ryan Nealy: delayed go hard
(04:00:58 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's so true
(04:01:08 PM) Ryan Nealy: of course I will
(04:01:10 PM) Ryan Nealy: that's why
(04:01:11 PM) jedireign: metting time

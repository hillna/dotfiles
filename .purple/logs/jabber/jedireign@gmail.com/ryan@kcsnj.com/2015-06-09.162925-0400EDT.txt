(04:52:36 PM) Ryan Nealy: will fix that stupid port
(04:52:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: w/e that was
(04:54:18 PM) jedireign: word
(04:54:21 PM) jedireign: reseat the card
(04:54:24 PM) jedireign: stick it in your butt first

(04:54:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: haha
(04:54:56 PM) Ryan Nealy: ur butt is ugly
(04:55:01 PM) jedireign: YOU BRUTE
(04:55:16 PM) Ryan Nealy: now if only I could get
(04:55:26 PM) Ryan Nealy: my fsmo roles at home to all consolidte to one server
(04:55:30 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'll be flying high baby
(04:55:35 PM) jedireign: aww yeahhh
(04:55:38 PM) jedireign: I gotta keep an eye out for mobos
(04:55:40 PM) jedireign: with lots of ram
(04:55:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: yay for ssd caching and storage tiering everything works so good
(04:55:42 PM) jedireign: and slots
(04:55:46 PM) jedireign: SLUTTY SLUTTY SLOTS
(04:55:56 PM) Ryan Nealy: socket 2011
(04:55:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: is your only hope
(04:56:11 PM) jedireign: yeah I'm OK spending money on this build
(04:56:15 PM) jedireign: I just wnat to build it sooner than later
(04:56:16 PM) jedireign: Lol
(04:56:21 PM) jedireign: I hope it lasts me like 5-10 years type of thing
(05:00:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: you can say I'm a dreamer
(05:00:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: but I'm not the only one
(05:00:35 PM) jedireign: haha yo that song is so bad
(05:00:44 PM) Ryan Nealy: no u
(05:00:57 PM) jedireign: but yeah with the right components that's not at all unreasonable
(05:01:07 PM) jedireign: hell my shitty shitty shitty NAS has lasted me about 6 or 7 at this point
(05:01:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah I mean
(05:01:14 PM) jedireign: that's with a bucnh of drive replacements lol
(05:01:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: I think I"m just never happy 
(05:01:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh I have 6 drives
(05:01:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: I need 8
(05:01:27 PM) jedireign: also it will be built to expand lol
(05:01:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh I have 970
(05:01:30 PM) Ryan Nealy: I need 980 TI
(05:01:38 PM) jedireign: pygmaleon quest, is what that is called
(05:01:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: building things that are expandable so fucking expensive
(05:01:41 PM) jedireign: also
(05:01:46 PM) jedireign: technology upgrades so fucking fast
(05:01:47 PM) jedireign: haha
(05:01:48 PM) jedireign: yeah
(05:01:50 PM) Ryan Nealy: could actually be cheaper
(05:01:52 PM) jedireign: there's NO investment in computer hardware
(05:01:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: to just not have that mentality at all
(05:01:56 PM) jedireign: just build cars
(05:02:00 PM) jedireign: you can at least sell those
(05:02:04 PM) Ryan Nealy: and just buy it maxed out
(05:02:05 PM) Ryan Nealy: for cheap
(05:02:07 PM) Ryan Nealy: then remax it in 3 years
(05:02:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: LOL
(05:02:19 PM) Ryan Nealy: REAL ESTATE THAT MOFO
(05:02:22 PM) Ryan Nealy: remax
(05:02:23 PM) Ryan Nealy: lolz
(05:02:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: I'm funny
(05:02:29 PM) jedireign: haha
(05:02:35 PM) jedireign: god damn it
(05:02:44 PM) Ryan Nealy: I just realized that's a pretty good plan
(05:02:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: hahahahahhaha
(05:02:48 PM) Ryan Nealy: did you just realize that
(05:03:01 PM) jedireign: lol no I've always built my shit a component at a time
(05:03:02 PM) jedireign: for like
(05:03:03 PM) jedireign: ever
(05:03:09 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah me too
(05:03:12 PM) Ryan Nealy: but in order to get what you want
(05:03:14 PM) jedireign: what is it
(05:03:16 PM) Ryan Nealy: you need pretty beast mobo
(05:03:16 PM) jedireign: ship of theseus
(05:03:18 PM) jedireign: is my comptuer
(05:03:20 PM) jedireign: Lol
(05:03:25 PM) Ryan Nealy: expensive ass mobo really
(05:03:25 PM) jedireign: yeah
(05:03:29 PM) Ryan Nealy: and tons of add on shit
(05:03:30 PM) jedireign: I think ECC I can ditch.
(05:03:31 PM) jedireign: I don't want to.
(05:03:33 PM) jedireign: but I think I will
(05:03:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: or you could just build something with 8 drives
(05:03:40 PM) jedireign: I'll need 2 slots for SATA cards
(05:03:45 PM) Ryan Nealy: and live with it until you are ready and build another with 8 bigger drives later
(05:03:50 PM) jedireign: maybe a slot fore esata if I can't find internal/external
(05:03:52 PM) jedireign: and a slot for a NIC
(05:03:58 PM) Ryan Nealy: ur gonna need
(05:03:59 PM) jedireign: 2 USBs internal for system OS
(05:04:00 PM) Ryan Nealy: a lot of shit
(05:04:02 PM) jedireign: and that's it
(05:04:11 PM) jedireign: 3 slots, good ram capacity, good CPU
(05:04:17 PM) jedireign: 6 onboard SATA
(05:04:21 PM) jedireign: (well 5 technically)
(05:04:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: 8
(05:04:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: you can get them with 8
(05:04:37 PM) Ryan Nealy: and even 10
(05:04:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: it's not THAT hard to find
(05:04:42 PM) jedireign: yeah, either 6 or 10
(05:04:48 PM) jedireign: I don't wnat to have arrays spanning controllers
(05:04:51 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh
(05:04:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: well yo uwill
(05:04:54 PM) Ryan Nealy: LOL
(05:04:55 PM) jedireign: so one 5 drive array per controller
(05:04:57 PM) jedireign: no I won't :)
(05:05:05 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah cause 10 port mobo come with secondary controller
(05:05:15 PM) jedireign: oh yeah with a 10 port board
(05:05:16 PM) Ryan Nealy: it' max of 6 per controller, that's the highest I've ever seen in workstation level boards
(05:05:18 PM) jedireign: but that sounds rare and expensive
(05:05:27 PM) jedireign: yeah exactly
(05:05:28 PM) Ryan Nealy: mine have 8
(05:05:30 PM) jedireign: get a board with 6
(05:05:32 PM) Ryan Nealy: I have 2 with 8
(05:05:36 PM) jedireign: then get a card with another 7
(05:05:37 PM) jedireign: 6*
(05:05:39 PM) Ryan Nealy: 6 on one 2 on another seperate one
(05:05:39 PM) jedireign: or 5
(05:05:40 PM) jedireign: or whatever
(05:05:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: fuck
(05:05:43 PM) Ryan Nealy: dude your so bad
(05:05:46 PM) jedireign: and do that for the other two arrays
(05:05:46 PM) Ryan Nealy: ur face looks like a ferret
(05:05:48 PM) jedireign: LOL
(05:05:57 PM) jedireign: Sorry if I have my build planned well :)
(05:05:59 PM) Ryan Nealy: ur voice sounds like a sick moose
(05:06:06 PM) Ryan Nealy: I can plan well too
(05:06:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: but I just dont' cause i know it'll cost too much
(05:06:13 PM) Ryan Nealy: lolz
(05:06:16 PM) jedireign: lmfao
(05:06:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: like WAY too much
(05:06:22 PM) jedireign: yeah that's why
(05:06:24 PM) Ryan Nealy: my budget for a home server is basically like
(05:06:25 PM) Ryan Nealy: none
(05:06:25 PM) jedireign: I use the board's onboard to start
(05:06:32 PM) jedireign: with 5 drives
(05:06:35 PM) Ryan Nealy: so considering that, my shit is pretty damn nice
(05:06:39 PM) jedireign: then add additional 5 drive arrays as I need more space
(05:06:52 PM) jedireign: maxing at 15 3.5" drives
(05:07:11 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah I don't need space
(05:07:16 PM) jedireign: I do :(
(05:07:17 PM) Ryan Nealy: I need redundancy
(05:07:20 PM) Ryan Nealy: and speed
(05:07:20 PM) jedireign: I need space more than VMs
(05:07:31 PM) jedireign: important stuff will be doubled onto my current NAS
(05:07:34 PM) jedireign: as a "bible box"
(05:07:34 PM) Ryan Nealy: omg
(05:07:37 PM) Ryan Nealy: you know what I need
(05:07:37 PM) jedireign: grab it when the house bunrs down
(05:07:39 PM) jedireign: kind of thing
(05:07:41 PM) Ryan Nealy: a fucking fart vacuum stat
(05:07:47 PM) Ryan Nealy: yah that's my little synology now
(05:07:53 PM) Ryan Nealy: grab it and run
(05:10:01 PM) Ryan Nealy: uh oh I broke ad
(05:10:02 PM) Ryan Nealy: badly
(05:10:37 PM) jedireign: uh oh ryan poopied
(05:16:27 PM) Ryan Nealy: oh nooo
(05:16:31 PM) Ryan Nealy: and I waswn't backing thato ne up

(10:25:11 AM) reignsphere: back home
(10:25:21 AM) reignsphere: http://www.iwi.us/TAVOR/TAVOR-G16 I want one of these pretty hard :O
(10:25:22 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Oh wow, thats an odd combination ..
(10:25:40 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: oh wow that'd be sick to have
(10:25:52 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: You had gotten all your permits didnt you ?
(10:26:15 AM) reignsphere: no permits.
(10:26:21 AM) reignsphere: this is america.
(10:26:27 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: lol
(10:26:41 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Ya but for fully automatic, I was pretty sure you needed federal permit
(10:26:45 AM) reignsphere: lmao BUT I got my NFA trust all set up for federally regulated snaz
(10:26:48 AM) reignsphere: that's not full auto
(10:26:59 AM) reignsphere: but no you don't need a permit for full auto
(10:27:09 AM) reignsphere: you need a background check and to pay a taxa to the BATFE
(10:27:10 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Welcome to America ;)
(10:27:16 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Ahh, gotcha
(10:27:24 AM) reignsphere: the thing is, no new full autos can be made forf civbilian transfer after May 1986
(10:27:27 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: You're that much closer to being Opie from SoA ;)
(10:27:29 AM) reignsphere: so to even think about the cheapest shit full auto
(10:28:00 AM) reignsphere: you're starting at $12,000+ for a stripped receiver. Then you file a BATFE Form 4 for transfer, which takes ~6 months to process, while your $12,000 gun sits at the dealer
(10:28:10 AM) reignsphere: and $200 tax
(10:28:18 AM) reignsphere: you then get an approval w/ a tax stamp
(10:28:21 AM) reignsphere: making your gun legal
(10:28:23 AM) reignsphere: so it's not
(10:28:31 AM) reignsphere: "qualify and prove need or whatever"
(10:28:32 AM) reignsphere: it's
(10:28:34 AM) reignsphere: "pay mroe money"
(10:28:35 AM) reignsphere: LOL
(10:28:38 AM) reignsphere: regulation is a joke.
(10:29:03 AM) reignsphere: anywho, through that form 4 process, you need local chief LEO sign off & finger printing
(10:29:29 AM) reignsphere: which my trust allows me to circumvent becausee you can't fingerprint a "legal entity" which is what will own silencers and short barrel rifles
(10:30:29 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: So in other words, you're all set for the Zombie Apocalypse ;)
(10:30:45 AM) reignsphere: yup
(10:30:54 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: that gun is badass
(10:30:59 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: 7.9 lbs .. jesus
(10:31:17 AM) reignsphere: yea
(10:31:18 AM) reignsphere: h
(10:31:27 AM) reignsphere: leave it to the israelies to know how to design a gun
(10:31:29 AM) reignsphere: oh oh oh
(10:31:31 AM) reignsphere: check this out
(10:31:39 AM) reignsphere: so there's a 9mm conversion for the tavor that takes glock mags
(10:32:10 AM) reignsphere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqGsV8UrRVQ they're working on a 5.56 version of this, but yeah, SPACE GUN
(10:32:46 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: omg
(10:33:58 AM) reignsphere: only $400 (plus $200 tax) too
(10:34:05 AM) reignsphere: which is ridiculous for an integral suppressor, let alone any suppressor
(10:34:16 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: wow, thats unbelievable
(10:34:27 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Thats sick lol
(10:34:29 AM) reignsphere: http://www.silencerco.com/products/osprey looking at this guy for my pistols
(10:34:37 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: My XD40s are no comparison to any of those.
(10:34:51 AM) reignsphere: lol
(10:34:56 AM) reignsphere: XDs are fun.
(10:35:25 AM) reignsphere: http://www.silencerco.com/products/salvo-12/ here you go
(10:36:02 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Ya, I got the interchangeable barrels from 9mm, .40, .45, and .45 SIG, plus chrome slides and the laser sights that integrate to the control arm
(10:36:12 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: With the butterfly holster ;)
(10:36:33 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Holy shit .. lol
(10:36:35 AM) reignsphere: butterfly holster?
(10:36:36 AM) reignsphere: not familiar
(10:36:48 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Well, it's I dunno the tehnical name
(10:36:55 AM) reignsphere: I converted my .40 S&W M&P Pro to 9mm because .40 is dumb
(10:37:04 AM) reignsphere: it's a neutered 10mm
(10:37:14 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: it's the one that they go on your back and sit above the waist.
(10:37:21 AM) reignsphere: so lets give up capacity and increase recoil for barely negligably better balistics 
(10:37:28 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: lol
(10:37:42 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: OMG look at the ladie's shottie lol
(10:37:44 AM) reignsphere: but then again my M&P holds 22 rounds
(10:38:03 AM) reignsphere: just a sec le me take a picture for you becasue ti's pretty.
(10:38:05 AM) reignsphere: haha
(10:38:09 AM) reignsphere: I redid the entire trigger package, too
(10:38:15 AM) reignsphere: so it's like 2.5oz, 2mm of movement
(10:38:17 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: I adjusted the springs in the clips to adjust from 12 to 15 rounds on the XD
(10:40:18 AM) reignsphere: http://img.nickh.info/ayBg
(10:41:17 AM) reignsphere: blacked out rear, fiber optic front
(10:41:46 AM) reignsphere: so what I want to do is: Get an M&P Pro CORE, replace the slide on that pistol with the CORE slide, put that slide on the CORE and duty/carry trigger pack, night sights, and make it my combat gun
(10:41:49 AM) reignsphere: it's very much a target pisto latm
(10:41:59 AM) reignsphere: with fiber optic sight, light ass trigger, etc.
(10:42:15 AM) reignsphere: I wouldn't carry this outside of a very controlled environment (like a range/competition) because of the LIGHT AS FUCK trigger w/ no safety
(10:46:30 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: wow
(10:46:32 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: thats badass
(10:46:40 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: remind me to stay friends with you ;)
(10:49:48 AM) reignsphere: ahhaha
(10:50:18 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: thats a sweet gun there
(10:50:34 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: I gotta stop looking, if I starting buying into this hobby too, my wife will kill me.
(10:56:04 AM) reignsphere: LOL
(10:56:12 AM) reignsphere: guns are a LOT more expensive than computers.
(10:56:20 AM) reignsphere: I didn't take a rider out on my insurance for computers.
(10:56:35 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: lol
(10:56:47 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Amen to that, my laser sights cost more then the gun did ;)
(10:57:08 AM) reignsphere: LOL
(10:57:12 AM) reignsphere: Man lasers are crap :(
(10:57:24 AM) reignsphere: a solution looking for a problem
(10:57:59 AM) reignsphere: oh wait do you have the like
(10:58:04 AM) reignsphere: recoil spring guide bar integrated one?
(10:58:05 AM) reignsphere: lol
(10:58:08 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Yup.
(10:58:56 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: I always call it the control, but yes it's the one that replaces the guide bar .. I only like lasers on my tacticals, I've never found or seen lasers for anything else that I liked.
(10:59:36 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: I originally wasn't going to go wit hthem, but after the chrome slides and the holster, I thought I might as well go for a style similiar to Hitman .. lol
(10:59:47 AM) reignsphere: lmfao
(10:59:56 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: The only thing I want to get now is the silencers, but I am super unsure if it'll throw the balance off.
(10:59:59 AM) reignsphere: yeah the only time I can see lasers being useful is IR w/ night vision
(11:00:09 AM) reignsphere: they become a little front heavy
(11:00:16 AM) reignsphere: but as long as yo udon't have little child wrists, you're fine.
(11:00:25 AM) |GoW| Demon_Farky: Lol
(11:00:28 AM) reignsphere: I have little child wrists and it's totally easy to control
(11:00:31 AM) reignsphere: and reduces recoil a ton
(11:01:09 AM) reignsphere: shot my full size 1911 with one a bunch
(11:01:17 AM) reignsphere: a buddy of mines (don't know the model)
(12:57:27 PM) reignsphere: fuck dude Rush is so good

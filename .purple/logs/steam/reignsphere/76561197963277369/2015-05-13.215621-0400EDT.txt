(10:02:18 PM) reignsphere: yooo
(10:02:24 PM) reignsphere: if you're there, I have the most random of phone questions for you
(10:02:31 PM) reignsphere: and you're the only guy I know who mightg know :D
(10:03:35 PM) Kurt: Haha what's up?
(10:03:40 PM) reignsphere: hahaha OK
(10:03:40 PM) reignsphere: so
(10:03:41 PM) reignsphere: hahaha
(10:03:43 PM) Kurt has left the conversation
(10:03:43 PM) reignsphere: RANDOM like I said
(10:03:58 PM) reignsphere: I have a galaxy s5 w/ a chinese as fuck wireless Qi charging pad installed
(10:04:06 PM) reignsphere: not the official samsung case back
(10:04:12 PM) reignsphere: so it's sandwiched in between
(10:04:12 PM) reignsphere: now
(10:04:13 PM) Kurt has left the conversation
(10:04:26 PM) reignsphere: I just added a dual sim module (and ahve an additional 3x sim module that I might replace it with)
(10:04:30 PM) reignsphere: it all works 
(10:04:31 PM) reignsphere: HOWEVER
(10:04:32 PM) reignsphere: it's like
(10:04:33 PM) reignsphere: STUFFED
(10:04:52 PM) reignsphere: in the case, and the back is bulging, and I doubt it's water proof anymore, annnnd it kind of rocks and rolls on a table and my bumper case no longer fits
(10:04:53 PM) reignsphere: haha
(10:04:53 PM) reignsphere: now
(10:04:55 PM) reignsphere: the question.
(10:04:55 PM) Kurt: Fair enough lol
(10:05:06 PM) Kurt has left the conversation
(10:05:14 PM) reignsphere: what I'm hoping to find is etiher a "slightly larger back plate" OR an expanded battery w/ back plate that has "some extra room"
(10:05:15 PM) reignsphere: hahaha
(10:05:17 PM) reignsphere: any suggesitons?
(10:05:24 PM) reignsphere: I think the battery back plate is my best option
(10:06:48 PM) reignsphere: even if I leave the original battery in
(10:07:08 PM) reignsphere: I can use some tape or foam to fill the gap, but still leave room (and hope wireless charge still works, might need to do some haxing there)
(10:09:59 PM) Kurt: Hmmm yeah that's a tough one. I know there are a few different extended battery options
(10:10:09 PM) reignsphere: yeah wondering if you have hands on on any of them
(10:11:13 PM) Kurt: Not personally used them but I've seen phones with them. They're usually pretty cheaply made though. I wouldn't count on preserving the water resistance 
(10:12:02 PM) reignsphere: yeah, hm
(10:12:05 PM) reignsphere: that's honestly lowest priority
(10:12:22 PM) reignsphere: at one point, before I repositioned everything in the back, the _screen_ was bulged out
(10:12:23 PM) reignsphere: LOL
(10:12:30 PM) reignsphere: now it's just the back, so less of a big deal,
(10:13:12 PM) Kurt: Lol. I've seen that when batteries get swolen it pushes put the front
(10:13:17 PM) reignsphere: lmfao
(10:13:18 PM) reignsphere: yeah
(10:13:23 PM) reignsphere: DON"T USE THAT BATTERY ANYMORE
(10:13:25 PM) reignsphere: dumbasses.
(10:13:36 PM) reignsphere: I'm surprised we don't see more cases of batttery on face explosion in cell phones
(10:13:43 PM) reignsphere: people are god damned stupid
(10:14:22 PM) Kurt: Right? That's one of a few things that's like.. Instant phone replacement with apple.
(10:14:26 PM) reignsphere: lol
(10:15:10 PM) reignsphere: dual sim si sweet, though
(10:15:19 PM) reignsphere: android picks it right up like "OH here's a little swither utility"
(10:15:23 PM) reignsphere: switcher
(10:16:08 PM) Kurt: Nice. What  sims are you using?
(10:17:23 PM) reignsphere: Right now I just have the tmobile, going to get a verizon pre paid for emergencies/no tmobile signal situations
(10:17:26 PM) reignsphere: because tmobile network is _garbage_
(10:17:50 PM) reignsphere: but for what it cost me for a single plan with verizon, rachael and I share a family plan on tmobile
(10:17:55 PM) reignsphere: so it makes sense.
(10:17:59 PM) reignsphere: also the jump program is _legit_
(10:18:03 PM) reignsphere: I smashed my nexus 5 by accident
(10:18:09 PM) reignsphere: used the replacemnet policy to jump upgrade
(10:18:15 PM) reignsphere: and the trade in was the pay off price for hte nexus 5
(10:18:36 PM) reignsphere: so new / upgraded phone at very minimal cost (plus paayment pl.an on new phone obviously, with old broke phones trade in going toward it)
(10:19:29 PM) Kurt: Yeah, nice nice. Speaking of, somehow I still haven't been kicked off of my T-Mobile employee discount plan even though I haven't worked there in oh, 6 months or so lol
(10:20:10 PM) reignsphere: lol yeah you won't be
(10:20:11 PM) reignsphere: ever
(10:20:18 PM) reignsphere: I had one with verizon like 2 years after I left best buy
(10:20:22 PM) reignsphere: (and the tmobile plan was still chaeper)
(10:24:27 PM) Kurt: Yeah it's def not a bad deal. 
(10:25:00 PM) Kurt: Btw you check out any of the humble bundle deals? They're having a spring sale, not unlike the steam ones
(10:25:02 PM) reignsphere: where should I get a prepaid sim do you know?
(10:25:04 PM) reignsphere: ohhhh
(10:25:08 PM) reignsphere: I haven't checked it out in a while
(10:25:15 PM) reignsphere: I used to get their spam all the time until I unsubbed
(10:34:31 PM) Kurt: Ah yeah. Some decent stuff on there. I bought Dark souls, which seems fun but is apparently super hard.
(10:34:46 PM) Kurt: I meant to ask, how is online GTA by the way
(10:35:16 PM) reignsphere: fucking great
(10:35:19 PM) reignsphere: until hax0rs fuck you over

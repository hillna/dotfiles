(11:20:52 AM) reignsphere: you maybe up for some of that there counter strikes?
(11:27:48 AM) Kurt: In a little bit yeah, gotta do a few things around the house. Then I'm down for striking some counters
(11:30:07 AM) reignsphere: worrrRRRRd
(11:30:15 AM) reignsphere: I miiiight go to the gun show and try and sell a pistol
(11:30:16 AM) reignsphere: mayb
(11:30:19 AM) reignsphere: estill debating
(11:30:24 AM) reignsphere: but if I'm not around when you return that's probably where I am
(11:41:00 AM) Kurt: No worries. You can always hop into CS and sell virtual pistols instead
(11:41:14 AM) Kurt: What're you selling anyway?
(11:41:42 AM) reignsphere: lmfao
(11:41:45 AM) reignsphere: maybe selling my 1911
(11:42:05 AM) reignsphere: we switched from monthly to biweekly pay at work and ti's got my scheduling all fucked up
(11:42:13 AM) reignsphere: so it's sell a pistol to build a buffer or use savings to build a buffer
(11:42:37 AM) reignsphere: neither of which I want to do.
(11:42:38 AM) Kurt: Ahh I hear you on that. 
(11:42:45 AM) reignsphere: LOL so I'm debating which will hurt my soul the least
(11:43:37 AM) reignsphere: considering, too, that 1911 is my primary home defense :D
(11:43:44 AM) reignsphere: so gotta re figure all that (not huge deal though)
(11:44:03 AM) reignsphere: but I like the subsonic / not overpenetrating nature of .45 for an apartment.
(11:44:10 AM) reignsphere: blah blah blah gurns
(11:44:20 AM) Kurt: Hmmm yeah. What else do you have these days?
(11:45:20 AM) reignsphere: 9mm compact M&P, 9mm 5" M&P pro, mossberg 500 12ga, AR-15 (which I'm rebuilding), two stripped AR-15 lowers with nothing on them yet, and ye ol Mosin
(11:45:51 AM) reignsphere: just got all my NFA trust paperwork done so I'll be diving into short barrels and silencers this year
(11:45:58 AM) Kurt: Nice nice. 
(11:48:41 AM) reignsphere: which is anothe reason I don't want to get rid of the .45 :D it's perfect to be silenced

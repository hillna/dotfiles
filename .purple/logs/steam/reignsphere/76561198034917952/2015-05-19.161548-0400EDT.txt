(04:19:15 PM) reignsphere: stinky D
(04:19:21 PM) reignsphere: is it that late alreayd?
(04:19:27 PM) Stinky Diver: 4:20
(04:22:09 PM) Stinky Diver: i wish our group played more fighting games like 2d fighting games
(04:22:14 PM) Stinky Diver: i want to go to evo so bad :(
(04:22:35 PM) reignsphere: hmmmm
(04:22:37 PM) reignsphere: I could be in to that
(04:22:39 PM) reignsphere: but Im aful at those
(04:23:05 PM) Stinky Diver: to be good at 2d fighters all you have to do is resist the ultimate temptation
(04:23:08 PM) Stinky Diver: mashing
(04:23:51 PM) Stinky Diver: once you get frustrated in a match and start just mashing every button its no longer a rock paper scissor, it becomes just unpredictable
(04:23:52 PM) reignsphere: haha yeah 
(04:23:54 PM) Stinky Diver: i mean it works in situations
(04:24:04 PM) reignsphere: I get that much
(04:24:04 PM) Stinky Diver: but you can usually tell and just block for a bit and punish it
(04:24:06 PM) reignsphere: I'm just no good at them
(04:24:12 PM) reignsphere: nor do I have the patience to learn move lists/counters/etc
(04:24:26 PM) Stinky Diver: ahhhh
(04:24:28 PM) reignsphere: so once yo uget past like
(04:24:30 PM) reignsphere: the most basic of combs
(04:24:31 PM) reignsphere: I don't have shit
(04:24:44 PM) Stinky Diver: yea fighting games do require a bit of practice and or research
(04:24:46 PM) reignsphere: unless it's like smash that has 10 moves.
(04:24:57 PM) reignsphere: but then that game just gets insane so fuck that LOL
(04:25:17 PM) Stinky Diver: situationally smash brothers is harder than some 2d fighters
(04:25:33 PM) Stinky Diver: 2d fighters when 2 good players are at it, its like dancing
(04:25:48 PM) reignsphere: yeah
(04:25:53 PM) reignsphere: I used to play a LOT of soul caliber
(04:25:56 PM) reignsphere: but only one character.
(04:26:00 PM) reignsphere: because fuck learning all those moves.
(04:26:04 PM) Stinky Diver: thats how i was
(04:26:09 PM) Stinky Diver: played the shit out of voldo
(04:26:17 PM) Stinky Diver: most people that go to tournaments only play 1 character
(04:26:24 PM) Stinky Diver: MAYBE 2 just so they can have an alt
(04:26:27 PM) Stinky Diver: for match ups
(04:27:37 PM) Stinky Diver: its just a matter of finding out what game you like the art style/playstyle of
(04:27:47 PM) Stinky Diver: once you have that nailed you pick a char
(04:27:59 PM) reignsphere: yeah I'm open for giving it a shot
(04:28:01 PM) reignsphere: as long as it's not like
(04:28:13 PM) reignsphere: mmarvel vs capcom 5000 move list OP combo nonsense
(04:28:20 PM) Stinky Diver: usually broken down into 2 types of games, like street fighter-ish graphics, or super anime crazy shiz
(04:28:25 PM) reignsphere: yeah
(04:28:28 PM) reignsphere: fuck the super anime crazy shit
(04:28:32 PM) reignsphere: fun to watch
(04:28:34 PM) reignsphere: not at all to play
(04:28:43 PM) Stinky Diver: its fun when you know whats going on xD
(04:28:50 PM) Stinky Diver: because the approaches get that much more insane
(04:29:03 PM) reignsphere: yeah I have no interest in learning what's going on is waht I mean by that
(04:29:03 PM) reignsphere: haha
(04:29:08 PM) Stinky Diver: perfect example of crazy anime 2d fighting nonsense
(04:29:09 PM) Stinky Diver: https://youtu.be/FFaP_2JxbAE
(04:29:15 PM) Stinky Diver: this is the character i used to play in guilty gear
(04:29:24 PM) Stinky Diver: SO hard to read because he has fuckign wonky and goofy moves
(04:29:41 PM) Stinky Diver: i always try to pick weirdest chars for the unpredictability factor
(04:29:46 PM) reignsphere: lol
(04:29:46 PM) Stinky Diver: i.e. voldo
(04:29:48 PM) reignsphere: _VOLDO_
(04:30:28 PM) Stinky Diver: king of the fighters is anime, but slowwwww
(04:30:36 PM) Stinky Diver: VERY strategic
(04:32:59 PM) Stinky Diver: king of fighters 13 i dont know if i could get past like a 7 hit combo
(04:33:07 PM) Stinky Diver: xD
(04:33:20 PM) Stinky Diver: maybe if i got lucky
(04:34:28 PM) Stinky Diver: hahhah idk man, fighting games are tricky to try and nail down a game for someone else to play
(04:34:33 PM) Stinky Diver: theyre all _SO_ different
(04:34:35 PM) reignsphere: lmfao yeah
(04:34:42 PM) reignsphere: I like the technical ones
(04:34:45 PM) reignsphere: taht aren't entirely chaotic
(04:34:49 PM) Stinky Diver: https://youtu.be/okCzGyeuQvQ
(04:34:57 PM) reignsphere: like soul calibur
(04:34:59 PM) Stinky Diver: thats a pro showing off combos
(04:35:00 PM) reignsphere: but those started to get _bad_
(04:35:03 PM) Stinky Diver: and they arent long
(04:35:05 PM) Stinky Diver: or fast
(04:36:13 PM) Stinky Diver: it seems liek mostly he does like a 5 hit combo with basic attacks, does like a special move dealy, then finishes off with his ultimate
(04:36:15 PM) Stinky Diver: for every combo
(04:36:28 PM) Stinky Diver: basic but hard as fuck to do in a match
(04:36:43 PM) Stinky Diver: (im no pro btw, even i get caught up mashing at times)
(04:37:08 PM) Stinky Diver: i am very good though and do understand some of the more complex aspects of fighting games
(04:37:27 PM) Stinky Diver: such as how many frames a move is, like 4 start up frames 3 active then like 5 recovery deal
(04:37:45 PM) Stinky Diver: i was trying to explain that to ryan one day and it was over his head
(04:38:26 PM) Stinky Diver: i.e. i throw a slow strong kick, it has 8 frames start up animation, 3 active hit frames, then like 5 recovery frames where he puts his leg back down or something
(04:39:21 PM) reignsphere: LOL yeah
(04:39:24 PM) reignsphere: fuck that level of insanity
(04:39:29 PM) reignsphere: haha did he get mad?
(04:39:34 PM) Stinky Diver: nah
(04:39:41 PM) reignsphere: I DON"T KNOW WHAT YOU"RE TALKING ABOUT SO YOU"RE WRONG
(04:39:44 PM) reignsphere: is a game he likes to play
(04:39:46 PM) Stinky Diver: he was just blindly saying he didnt understand
(04:39:49 PM) reignsphere: nice
(04:39:49 PM) Stinky Diver: and got annoyed
(04:39:51 PM) Stinky Diver: not so much mad
(04:39:56 PM) Stinky Diver: i was like
(04:39:56 PM) Stinky Diver: dude
(04:40:02 PM) Stinky Diver: every time the characters animation changes

(04:46:58 PM) Stinky Diver: The Game Genie was announced May 8 1990 and Nintendo of America then sued Galoob May 17 1990 for copyright infringement and demanded them to stop marketing Game Genie, which was scheduled to hit store shelves in late July 1990, retailing at about $50.
(04:47:05 PM) reignsphere: lmao yeah
(04:47:19 PM) reignsphere: nintendo lost the shit out of that lawsuit
(04:47:25 PM) reignsphere: but it still didn't stop them from trying to get around it
(04:47:31 PM) reignsphere: GALOOOOB
(04:47:31 PM) Stinky Diver: kind of not really
(04:47:32 PM) reignsphere: haha
(04:47:35 PM) reignsphere: yeah they tried

(04:47:36 PM) reignsphere: they didn't win
(04:47:45 PM) Stinky Diver: camerica got rekt then galoob took over
(04:47:51 PM) reignsphere: not familiar with camerica
(04:47:55 PM) Stinky Diver: idk, i havent read the story in a while
(04:48:04 PM) Stinky Diver: camerica was the canadian company that sold game genie first
(04:48:16 PM) reignsphere: oh yeah it was a US court thing
(04:48:19 PM) reignsphere: so it stil lsold in canada
(04:48:25 PM) Stinky Diver: yup
(04:48:30 PM) reignsphere: nintendo sued galoob, galoob had to halt sales in US, nintendo lost suit, could do nothing to prevent sale
(04:48:35 PM) Stinky Diver: yes
(04:48:36 PM) Stinky Diver: thats it
(04:48:37 PM) reignsphere: nintendo then tried to isntall checksum checks in games
(04:48:42 PM) reignsphere: they got around them with additional codes
(04:48:47 PM) Stinky Diver: then after that case was over camerica stopped making them and galoob took over
(04:48:49 PM) reignsphere: then later revision comletely stealthed it
(04:48:56 PM) Stinky Diver: cause i know camerica game genies stell for slightly more

(04:49:50 PM) Stinky Diver: some shit
(04:50:01 PM) Stinky Diver: then galoob offered adapters but theyre rare as fuck
(04:50:06 PM) Stinky Diver: cause you had to mail in shit to get one

(04:50:35 PM) Stinky Diver: i think it was turok 2 that was broken as fuck
(04:50:42 PM) Stinky Diver: final mission of co-op was unbeatable
(04:50:58 PM) Stinky Diver: so they had to have people mail in their copies to get the patch or something

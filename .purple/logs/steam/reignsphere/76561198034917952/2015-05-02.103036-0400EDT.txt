(10:50:23 AM) reignsphere: ha I love their whole #fighthenoise campaign
(10:50:26 AM) reignsphere: Nah I hate biweekly pay

(10:51:40 AM) reignsphere: I've been getting paid monthly for the past ...
(10:51:43 AM) reignsphere: 6 years

(10:53:09 AM) reignsphere: acutally they're the same gun shh
(10:53:15 AM) reignsphere: but yeah
(10:53:16 AM) reignsphere: LOL
(10:53:25 AM) Stinky Diver: just different length silencers right?
(10:53:29 AM) reignsphere: yeah
(10:53:39 AM) reignsphere: getting silencers is a pain in the urethra
(10:53:58 AM) Stinky Diver: why
(10:54:04 AM) reignsphere: federally regulated
(10:54:14 AM) reignsphere: under the national firearms act of 1936
(10:54:16 AM) Stinky Diver: well yea it makes sense why
(10:54:20 AM) reignsphere: nah it really doesn't
(10:54:28 AM) reignsphere: silencers are a hearing safety device
(10:54:29 AM) Stinky Diver: i mean
(10:54:35 AM) reignsphere: they're not the pew pew pew assasin no one knows they're there of the movies
(10:54:41 AM) reignsphere: they reduce gun shots to just barely hearing safe
(10:54:41 AM) Stinky Diver: it makes it alot easier to get away with crimes too
(10:54:45 AM) reignsphere: they're still like 120dB
(10:54:48 AM) reignsphere: except it doesn't at all
(10:55:06 AM) reignsphere: find me one instance of an NFA weapon being used in a crime
(10:55:08 AM) reignsphere: I bet yo ucan't ;D
(10:55:22 AM) reignsphere: lik
(10:55:24 AM) reignsphere: ea silenced gun shot
(10:55:27 AM) reignsphere: is still fucking LOUD AS SHIT
(10:55:33 AM) reignsphere: it's just like
(10:55:42 AM) reignsphere: 120-130 dB instead of like 160
(10:55:48 AM) reignsphere: so tinnitus vs non tinnitus
(10:55:52 AM) reignsphere: it's still rock concert loud.
(10:56:25 AM) reignsphere: I am 100% all for the repealing of the national firearms act
(10:56:29 AM) reignsphere: because it's shit legislation to begin with
(10:56:36 AM) reignsphere: and the purpose of it (making handguns illegal) failed
(10:56:48 AM) reignsphere: but all of the "loops hole fixes for peole to still have handguns" are still there
(10:56:50 AM) reignsphere: So like
(10:56:57 AM) reignsphere: short barreled rivfle provisions all that shit
(10:57:09 AM) reignsphere: those were put 
(10:57:13 AM) reignsphere: in there so that people couldn't like
(10:57:20 AM) reignsphere: convert a rifle into a small handgun type thing to conceal it
(10:57:30 AM) reignsphere: _but handguns aren't illegal_ so it's completely pointless
(10:57:45 AM) reignsphere: so if I want like
(10:57:45 AM) Stinky Diver: lmao
(10:57:48 AM) reignsphere: a sawed off shotgu
(10:57:51 AM) reignsphere: gotta pya $200 to the feds
(10:57:55 AM) reignsphere: wait 6 months for approval
(10:58:01 AM) reignsphere: and if I didn't make a revokable living turst
(10:58:12 AM) reignsphere: I have to get the local chief police approval, finger prints, etc
(10:58:13 AM) reignsphere: so fuck that
(10:58:14 AM) reignsphere: I made a trust
(10:58:23 AM) reignsphere: My finger pritns arne't on record and I'm keeping in that way
(10:58:40 AM) reignsphere: so liek
(10:58:41 AM) reignsphere: for silencer
(10:58:43 AM) reignsphere: I go to the gun shop
(10:58:47 AM) reignsphere: give them $800 whatever for the silencer
(10:58:50 AM) reignsphere: they give me back paperwork.
(10:58:57 AM) reignsphere: I send that paperwork to the ATFF with $200 for a tax stamp
(10:58:58 AM) reignsphere: and wait.
(10:59:05 AM) reignsphere: then 6 monhtsl ater I get m ytax stamp
(10:59:08 AM) reignsphere: and go pick up my silencer
(10:59:20 AM) Stinky Diver: retarded
(10:59:24 AM) reignsphere: same goes for short barreled rifles, machine guns ,etc
(10:59:29 AM) reignsphere: But machine guns are a little extra special
(10:59:32 AM) reignsphere: 1986
(10:59:52 AM) reignsphere: made "new prodcution civilian transferrable machine guns" unavailable
(11:00:12 AM) reignsphere: meaning you can't add a post May 1986 machine gun to a transferrable registry
(11:00:21 AM) reignsphere: so fi you want a machine gun, it has to be pre 1986
(11:00:25 AM) reignsphere: so supply and demand, right
(11:00:45 AM) reignsphere: turns what should be a $200 ar-15 receiver int oa $15,000 m16 receiver
(11:00:51 AM) reignsphere: mac-10s and shit are wayyyy cheaper
(11:00:54 AM) reignsphere: at $10,000 starting.
(11:01:40 AM) reignsphere: but shooting machine guns is stupid fun
(11:01:41 AM) reignsphere: :D:D:D
(11:01:52 AM) reignsphere: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=481499570
(11:01:53 AM) reignsphere: 22,000
(11:02:09 AM) reignsphere: for a beat to shit nam era m16 LOL
(11:03:04 AM) reignsphere: https://tacconusa.com/press/ so I'm going to put one of these into my SBR lower
(11:03:15 AM) reignsphere: it uses the return force of the bolt to pop the trigger forward
(11:03:29 AM) reignsphere: so if you just hold it down, it "wiggles" in  your finger and you're still technically pulling the trigger once for eac hshot
(11:03:36 AM) reignsphere: so nto "full auto" and not regulated
(11:03:36 AM) reignsphere: :D
(11:03:47 AM) reignsphere: (further pointing out the retardedness that is american gun laws)
(11:04:04 AM) reignsphere: Imagine if there were a hundred thousand "gotchas' for the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc amendments
(11:04:06 AM) reignsphere: -_-
(11:04:07 AM) reignsphere: 'murica.
(11:05:00 AM) reignsphere: (I know way too much about guns. I should get into gun-law)

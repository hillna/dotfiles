Well a jealous stable boy hears about this, goes and tells the redcoats. They come so they can ambush him, and tie her up with a musket at her chest. I'm not sure but she might have been raped as well. She hears him coming, and pulls the trigger on the musket, killing herself, to warn him with the shot. He CHARGES IN like a boss, and gets fucking slayed in the road.
